Copy number variations (CNVs) have garnered increasing attention within the 
realm of genetics due to their prevalence in human, animal, and plant genomes. 
These structural genetic variations have demonstrated associations with a broad 
spectrum of phenotypic diversity, economic traits, environmental adaptations, 
epidemics, and other essential aspects of both plants and animals. Furthermore, 
CNVs exhibit extensive sequence variability and encompass a wide array of 
genomes. The advancement and maturity of microarray and sequencing technologies 
have catalyzed a surge in research endeavors pertaining to CNVs. This is 
particularly prominent in the context of livestock breeding, where molecular 
markers have gained prominence as a valuable tool in comparison to traditional 
breeding methods. In light of these developments, a contemporary and 
comprehensive review of existing studies on CNVs becomes imperative. This review 
serves the purpose of providing a brief elucidation of the fundamental concepts 
underlying CNVs, their mutational mechanisms, and the diverse array of detection 
methods employed to identify these structural variations within genomes. 
Furthermore, it seeks to systematically analyze the recent advancements and 
findings within the field of CNV research, specifically within the genomes of 
herbivorous livestock species, including cattle, sheep, horses, and donkeys. The 
review also highlighted the role of CNVs in shaping various phenotypic traits 
including growth traits, reproductive traits, pigmentation and disease 
resistance etc., in herbivorous livestock. The main goal of this review is to 
furnish readers with an up-to-date compilation of knowledge regarding CNVs in 
herbivorous livestock genomes. By integrating the latest research findings and 
insights, it is anticipated that this review will not only offer pertinent 
information but also stimulate future investigations into the realm of CNVs in 
livestock. In doing so, it endeavors to contribute to the enhancement of 
breeding strategies, genomic selection, and the overall improvement of 
herbivorous livestock production and resistance to diseases.

Exome sequencing (ES) is a recommended first-tier diagnostic test for many rare 
monogenic diseases. It allows for the detection of both single-nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) in coding exonic regions of the 
genome in a single test, and this dual analysis is a valuable approach, 
especially in limited resource settings. Single-nucleotide variants are well 
studied; however, the incorporation of copy number variant analysis tools into 
variant calling pipelines has not been implemented yet as a routine diagnostic 
test, and chromosomal microarray is still more widely used to detect copy number 
variants. Research shows that combined single and copy number variant analysis 
can lead to a diagnostic yield of up to 58%, increasing the yield with as much 
as 18% from the single-nucleotide variant only pipeline. Importantly, this is 
achieved with the consideration of computational costs only, without incurring 
any additional sequencing costs. This mini review provides an overview of copy 
number variant analysis from exome data and what the current recommendations are 
for this type of analysis. We also present an overview on rare monogenic disease 
research standard practices in resource-limited settings. We present evidence 
that integrating copy number variant detection tools into a standard exome 
sequencing analysis pipeline improves diagnostic yield and should be considered 
a significantly beneficial addition, with relatively low-cost implications. 
Routine implementation in underrepresented populations and limited resource 
settings will promote generation and sharing of CNV datasets and provide 
momentum to build core centers for this niche within genomic medicine.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has taken on major importance in clinical 
oncology practice. With the advent of targeted therapies capable of effectively 
targeting specific genomic alterations in cancer patients, the development of 
bioinformatics processes has become crucial. Thus, bioinformatics pipelines play 
an essential role not only in the detection and in identification of molecular 
alterations obtained from NGS data but also in the analysis and interpretation 
of variants, making it possible to transform raw sequencing data into meaningful 
and clinically useful information. In this review, we aim to examine the 
multiple steps of a bioinformatics pipeline as used in current clinical 
practice, and we also provide an updated list of the necessary bioinformatics 
tools. This resource is intended to assist researchers and clinicians in their 
genetic data analyses, improving the precision and efficiency of these processes 
in clinical research and patient care.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness 
worldwide. In late-stage AMD, geographic atrophy (GA) of dry AMD or choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) of neovascular AMD eventually results in macular 
atrophy (MA), leading to significant visual loss. Despite the development of 
innovative therapies, there are currently no established effective treatments 
for MA. As a result, early detection of MA is critical in identifying later 
central macular involvement throughout time. Accurate and early diagnosis is 
achieved through a combination of clinical examination and imaging techniques. 
Our review of the literature depicts advances in retinal imaging to identify 
biomarkers of progression and risk factors for late AMD. Imaging methods like 
fundus photography; dye-based angiography; fundus autofluorescence (FAF); 
near-infrared reflectance (NIR); optical coherence tomography (OCT); and optical 
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) can be used to detect and monitor the 
progression of retinal atrophy. These evolving diverse imaging modalities 
optimize detection of pathologic anatomy and measurement of visual function; 
they may also contribute to the understanding of underlying mechanistic 
pathways, particularly the underlying MA changes in late AMD.

INTRODUCTION: In human genetic disorders, copy number variations (CNVs) are 
considered a considerable underlying cause. CNVs are generally detected by 
array-based methods but can also be discovered by read-depth analysis of 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. We performed WES-based CNV identification in 
a cohort of 35 Iranian families with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) 
patients.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients whose routine single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) 
and insertion/deletion analyses from exome data were unrevealing underwent a 
pipeline of CNV analysis using the read-depth detection method. Subsequently, a 
comprehensive search about the existence of CNVs in all 84 known HSP-causing 
genes was carried out in all reported HSP cases, so far.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: CNV analysis of exome data indicated that 1 patient 
harbored a heterozygous deletion in exon 17 of the SPAST gene. Multiplex 
ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis confirmed this deletion in the 
proband and his affected father. Literature review demonstrated that, to date, 
pathogenic CNVs have been identified in 30 out of 84 HSP-causing genes (∼36%). 
However, CNVs in only 17 of these genes were specifically associated with the 
HSP phenotype. Among them, CNVs were more common in L1CAM, PLP1, SPAST, SPG7, 
SPG11, and REEP1 genes. The identification of the CNV in 1 of our patients 
suggests that WES allows the detection of both SNVs and CNVs from a single 
method without additional costs and execution time. However, because of 
intrinsic issues of WES in the detection of large rearrangements, it may not yet 
be exploited to replace the CNV detection methods in standard clinical practice.

Manual detection of eye diseases using retina Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) 
images by Ophthalmologists is time consuming, prone to errors and tedious. 
Previous researchers have developed a computer aided system using deep 
learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to aid in faster detection 
of the retina diseases. However, these methods find it difficult to achieve 
better classification performance due to noise in the OCT image. Moreover, the 
pooling operations in CNN reduce resolution of the image that limits the 
performance of the model. The contributions of the paper are in two folds. 
Firstly, this paper makes a comprehensive literature review to establish 
current-state-of-act methods successfully implemented in retina OCT image 
classifications. Additionally, this paper proposes a capsule network coupled 
with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE-CapsNet) for retina 
OCT image classification. The CLAHE was implemented as layers to minimize the 
noise in the retina image for better performance of the model. A three-layer 
convolutional capsule network was designed with carefully chosen 
hyperparameters. The dataset used for this study was presented by University of 
California San Diego (UCSD). The dataset consists of 84,495 X-Ray images (JPEG) 
and 4 categories (NORMAL, CNV, DME, and DRUSEN). The images went through a 
grading system consisting of multiple layers of trained graders of expertise for 
verification and correction of image labels. Evaluation experiments were 
conducted and comparison of results was done with state-of-the-art models to 
find out the best performing model. The evaluation metrics; accuracy, 
sensitivity, precision, specificity, and AUC are used to determine the 
performance of the models. The evaluation results show that the proposed model 
achieves the best performing model of accuracies of 97.7%, 99.5%, and 99.3% on 
overall accuracy (OA), overall sensitivity (OS), and overall precision (OP), 
respectively. The results obtained indicate that the proposed model can be 
adopted and implemented to help ophthalmologists in detecting retina OCT 
diseases.

Fetus in fetu (FIF) is a rare congenital anomaly that originates from various 
sites of the host twin's body. The clinical manifestations of FIF are diverse 
and the location and size of FIF indicate the degree of threat, which may 
directly affect the prognosis. A 33-year-old woman presented at the hospital 
with an abdominal mass in her fetus. Prenatal ultrasound observed that mass 
included soft tissue, bone-like structures, and fluid. Immature cartilage, nerve 
tissue, muscle tissue, and glands in the parasitic fetus without signs of 
neoplastic lesions were reported by histological examination. CNV (copy number 
variation) and WES (whole exome sequencing) did not detect any abnormal 
mutations. FIF can continue to grow with gestational age or host infant growth. 
So complete resection is essential for improving the outcome of the host twin. 
It is also important that long-term follow-up is recommended to monitor any 
residual or recurrent cysts or malignancies.

The morbidity and mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains 
high in China. ESCC is significantly influenced by a complex interplay of 
environmental and genetic factors. Copy number variations (CNVs) are a major 
form of genome‑scale changes in ESCC and are closely related to tumorigenesis 
and development. Genome‑wide detection and analysis allow the identification of 
important CNV‑affected genes with potential clinical applications. In both 
coding and non‑coding regions, CNVs have been identified frequently in certain 
segments of chromosomes. CNV‑impacted genes have crucial roles in multiple 
cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and 
metabolic pathways. More importantly, they may serve as potential therapeutic 
targets for patients with ESCC. Therefore, studying the role of CNVs in ESCC is 
helpful to explore the pathogenesis of ESCC and to find effective treatment 
targets, which have profound implications for the diagnosis and therapy of ESCC.

BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) due to the RRAS2 gene, the pathogenic variant 
is an extremely rare RASopathies. Our objective was to identify the potential 
site of RRAS2, combined with the literature review, to find the correlation 
between clinical phenotype and genotype. De novo missense mutations affect 
different aspects of the RRAS2 function, leading to hyperactivation of the 
RAS-MAPK signaling cascade.
METHODS: Conventional G-banding was used to analyze the chromosome karyotype of 
the patient. Copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq) was used to detect the 
chromosomal gene microstructure of the patient and her parents. The exomes of 
the patient and her parents were sequenced using trio-based whole exome 
sequencing (trio-WES) technology. The candidate variant was verified by Sanger 
sequencing. The pathogenicity of the variant was predicted with a variety of 
bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: Chromosome analysis of the proband revealed 46, XX, and no abnormality 
was found by CNV-seq. After sequencing and bioinformatics filtering, the variant 
of RRAS2(c.67G>T; p. Gly23Cys) was found in the proband, while the mutation was 
absent in her parents. To the best of our knowledge, our patient was with the 
typical Noonan syndrome, such as short stature, facial dysmorphism, and 
developmental delay. Furthermore, our study is the first case of NS with 
embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) caused by the RRAS2 gene mutation reported in 
China.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigations suggested that the heterozygous missense of 
RRAS2 may be a potential causal variant in a rare cause of Noonan syndrome, 
expanding our understanding of the causally relevant mutations for this 
disorder.

X-linked recessive ichthyosis (XLI) is clinically characterized by dark brown, 
widespread dryness with polygonal scales. We describe the identification of STS 
and PUDP deletions using targeted panel sequencing combined with copy-number 
variation (CNV) analysis in XLI. A 9-month-old infant was admitted for genetic 
counseling. Since the second day after birth, the infant's skin tended to be dry 
and polygonal scales had accumulated over the abdomen and upper extremities. The 
infant's maternal uncle and brother (who had also exhibited similar skin 
symptoms from birth) presented with polygonal scales on their trunks. CNV 
analysis revealed a hemizygous deletion spanning 719.3 Kb on chromosome Xp22 
(chrX:7,108,996-7,828,312), which included a segment of the STS gene and 
exhibited a Z ratio of -2 in the proband. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
amplification (MLPA) confirmed this interstitial Xp22.31 deletion. Our report 
underscores the importance of implementing CNV screening techniques, including 
sequencing data analysis and gene dosage assays such as MLPA, to detect 
substantial deletions that encompass the STS gene region of Xq22 in individuals 
suspected of having XLI.

BACKGROUND: NPRL2-related epilepsy, caused by pathogenic germline variants of 
the NPRL2 gene, is a newly discovered childhood epilepsy linked to enhanced 
mTORC1 signalling. However, the phenotype and genotype of NPRL2 variants are 
still poorly understood. Here, we summarize the association between the 
phenotype and genotype of NPRL2-related epilepsy.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted for four Chinese children with 
epilepsy due to likely pathogenic NPRL2 variants identified through whole-exome 
sequencing (WES). Previous reports of patients with NPRL2-related epilepsy were 
reviewed systematically.
RESULTS: One of our patients presented focal epilepsy involving the central 
region, which should be distinguished from self-limited epilepsy with 
centrotemporal spikes (SeLECTS). The four novel likely pathogenic NPRL2 variants 
consisted of two nonsense variants, one frameshift variant, and one copy number 
variant (CNV). Bioinformatics analysis revealed the two nonsense variants to be 
highly conserved and cause alterations in protein structure. Including our four 
cases, a total of 33 patients with NPRL2-related epilepsy have been identified 
to date. The most common presentation is focal epilepsy (70%), including 
sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and 
frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE). Infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) is also 
a notable feature of NPRL2-related epilepsy. Malformations of cortical 
development (MCD, 8/20), especially focal cortical dysplasia (FCD, 6/20), are 
common neuroimaging abnormalities. Two-thirds of the NPRL2 variants reported are 
loss of function (LoF) (14/21). Among these mutations, c.100C>T (p.Arg34*) and 
c.314T>C (p.Leu105Pro) have been detected in two families (likely due to a 
founder effect).
CONCLUSION: NPRL2-related epilepsy shows high phenotypic and genotypic 
heterogeneity. Our study expands the genotype spectrum of NPRL2-related 
epilepsy, and the phenotype of focal epilepsy involving the central region 
should be clearly distinguished with SeLECTS, with reference value for clinical 
diagnosis.

AIMS: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is an autosomal dominant 
monogenic form of diabetes, and glucokinase-maturity-onset diabetes of the young 
(GCK-MODY), or MODY 2, being the most prevalent type. However, the presence of 
copy number variants (CNVs) may lead to misdiagnoses, as genetic testing for 
MODY is typically reliant on sequencing techniques. This study aimed to describe 
the process of diagnosis in a Chinese pedigree with an exon 8-10 deletion of the 
GCK gene.
METHODS: This study collected clinical data and medical history through direct 
interviews with the patient and reviewing relevant medical records. Sanger 
sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES) were conducted over years of follow 
up. WES-based CNV sequencing technology was used to detect CNVs and the results 
were validated by multiplex ligation-dependent amplification dosage assay 
(MLPA). Additionally, we reviewed the previously reported cases caused by 
heterozygous exon deletion of the GCK gene.
RESULTS: WES-based CNV detection revealed a heterozygous exon 8-10 deletion in 
the GCK gene within this particular pedigree after Sanger sequencing and WES 
failed to find causal variants in single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small 
indels. The deletion was considered pathogenic according to ACMG/AMP and ClinGen 
guidelines. Most of the previously reported cases caused by heterozygous exon 
deletion or whole gene deletion of the GCK gene present similarly to GCK-MODY 
caused by SNVs and small indels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study contributed to progress in our comprehension of the 
mutation spectrum of the GCK gene and underscored the significance of CNV 
detection in the genetic testing of MODY.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of combined copy number variation sequencing 
(CNV-seq) and chromosomal karyotyping for the diagnosis of amniocytic 
mosaicisms, in addition with a literature review.
METHODS: Forty cases of amniocytic mosaicisms detected at the Genetic and 
Prenatal Diagnosis Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou 
University from January 2018 to December 2021, in addition with 245 mosaicisms 
retrieved from 11 recent literature were evaluated in terms of detection rate, 
consistency rate, and pregnancy outcomes.
RESULTS: The detection rate of amniocytic mosaicisms was 0.46% (40/8 621) in our 
center. And its consistency rate with chromosomal karyotyping was 75.0% (30/40). 
After genetic counseling, 30 (75.0%) couples had opted to terminate the 
pregnancy, 5 (12.5%) had decided to continue with the pregnancy, 3 (7.5%) 
fetuses were born alive, and 2 cases (5.0%) were lost in touch. By contrast, 245 
cases (0.39%) of mosaicisms were identified among 63 577 amniotic samples, with 
a consistency rate of 62.8% (103/164) with other techniques. Among these, 114 
cases (55.1%) were terminated, 75 (36.2%) were born alive, and 18 (8.7%) were 
lost during the follow up.
CONCLUSION: Combined CNV-seq and chromosomal karyotyping has a high value for 
the detection of amniotic mosaicisms.

Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a new genome-wide technology that can reveal 
both structural genomic variations (SVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in a 
single assay. OGM was initially employed to perform genome assembly and genome 
research, but it is now more widely used to study chromosome aberrations in 
genetic disorders and in human cancer. One of the most useful OGM applications 
is in hematological malignancies, where chromosomal rearrangements are frequent 
and conventional cytogenetic analysis alone is insufficient, necessitating 
further confirmation using ancillary techniques such as fluorescence in situ 
hybridization, chromosomal microarrays, or multiple ligation-dependent probe 
amplification. The first studies tested OGM efficiency and sensitivity for SV 
and CNV detection, comparing heterogeneous groups of lymphoid and myeloid 
hematological sample data with those obtained using standard cytogenetic 
diagnostic tests. Most of the work based on this innovative technology was 
focused on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas little attention was paid to chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or multiple myeloma (MM), and none was paid to 
lymphomas. The studies showed that OGM can now be considered as a highly 
reliable method, concordant with standard cytogenetic techniques but able to 
detect novel clinically significant SVs, thus allowing better patient 
classification, prognostic stratification, and therapeutic choices in 
hematological malignancies.

(1) Background: Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a novel approach to identifying 
genomic structural variations with high accuracy and resolution. We report a 
proband with severe short stature caused by 46, XY, der (16) ins (16;15) (q23; 
q21.3q14) that was detected by OGM combined with other tests and review the 
clinical features of patients with duplication within 15q14q21.3; (2) Methods: 
OGM, whole exon sequencing (WES), copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq), 
and karyotyping were used; (3) Results: The proband was a 10.7-year-old boy with 
a complaint of severe short stature (-3.41SDS) and abnormal gait. He had growth 
hormone deficiency, lumbar lordosis, and epiphyseal dysplasia of both femurs. 
WES and CNV-seq showed a 17.27 Mb duplication of chromosome 15, and there was an 
insertion in chromosome 16 found by karyotyping. Furthermore, OGM revealed that 
duplication of 15q14q21.3 was inversely inserted into 16q23.1, resulting in two 
fusion genes. A total of fourteen patients carried the duplication of 
15q14q21.3, with thirteen previously reported and one from our center, 42.9% of 
which were de novo. In addition, neurologic symptoms (71.4%,10/14) were the most 
common phenotypes; (4) Conclusions: OGM combined with other genetic methods can 
reveal the genetic etiology of patients with the clinical syndrome, presenting 
great potential for use in properly diagnosing in the genetic cause of the 
clinical syndrome.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic etiology of a child with facial dysmorphia, 
developmental delay, intellectual disability, Fanconi renotubular syndrome, and 
Chiari malformations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES), Copy number variation 
sequencing (CNV-seq), and mitochondrial gene detection (Long-PCR + NGS) were 
applied to detect possible pathogenic mutations and chromosomal copy number 
variations (CNVs), together with databases and literature reviews to clarify the 
pathological significance of the candidate mutations.
RESULTS: The WES revealed a 2.10 Mb interstitial deletion from 11q13.3 to 
11q13.4, which was later confirmed by CNV-seq involving 11 OMIM genes, among 
which SHANK2, DHCR7, NADSYN1, FADD, NUMA1, IL18BP, ANO1, and FGF3 are 
disease-causing. The mitochondrial gene shows no variations.
CONCLUSION: The child has carried a de novo 11q13.3q13.4 microdeletion, in which 
SHANK2 genes may be the key gene responsible for the phenotype of intellectual 
disability. The renal manifestation of the child, which can be diagnosed as 
Fanconi renotubular syndrome, has an unknown cause but may result from the 
effect of the ANO1 gene. This case adds a new phenotype to the deletion of this 
region.

Medical Center, Lebanon.

OBJECTIVE: To report the case of a young woman with repeated conception failure, 
whose karyotype showed an unbalanced complex chromosomal rearrangement involving 
a large duplication harboring >115 genes and overlapping the 8p23.1 duplication 
syndrome region. The 8p23.1 duplication syndrome results from a tandem 
duplication on the short arm of chromosome 8 containing the 4 genes (GATA4, 
TNKS, SOX7, XKR6) responsible for the most common phenotypic features: 
developmental delay/learning disabilities, congenital heart disease and 
dysmorphism.
DESIGN: Case report and review of the literature.
SETTING: American University of Beirut Medical Center, department of Pathology 
and Laboratory medicine.Patient(s): Young woman referred to the genetic clinics 
for the workup of secondary idiopathic infertility with multiple unsuccessful 
inseminations and in vitro fertilizations.
INTERVENTIONS: Peripheral blood karyotype analysis from the patient and her 
parents. Elucidation of the CCR required whole chromosome painting Fluorescent 
in Situ Hybridization and Chromosomal Microarray.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The few published reports on 8p23.1 duplication syndrome 
(<50 cases) describing carriers reveal a wide range of phenotypic consequences 
with heterogeneous severity. The main outcome is to further understand this 
syndrome.
RESULTS: Chromosomal microarray analysis detected a large (12Mb) pathogenic Copy 
Number Variant (CNV) at 8p23.3p23.1, overlapping the 8p23.1 duplication syndrome 
region. This CNV, classified as pathogenic, was shown to carry little 
significance in our patient.
CONCLUSIONS: 8p23.1 duplication syndrome display a variable expressivity, 
ranging from overt syndromic features to minimal effect on the phenotype as 
shown in this case. Interpretation of prenatal detection of 8p23.1 duplication 
especially in preimplantation diagnosis is thus challenging. Nevertheless, this 
case emphasizes the importance of genetic testing in infertile patients 
displaying a normal phenotype.

BACKGROUND: Chromosome 16p13.11 duplication is a well-known genetic risk factor 
for schizophrenia (SCZ) (odds ratio = 1.84). However, no case reports focusing 
on patients with SCZ and 16p13.11 duplication have been published. Therefore, 
here, we report the detailed clinical cases of four patients with SCZ and 
16p13.11 duplication who were identified in our previous whole-genome copy 
number variant (CNV) study.
CASE PRESENTATION: In the four patients with SCZ and 16p13.11 duplication 
detected by array comparative genomic hybridization, one patient was found to 
have treatment-resistant SCZ and an additional pathogenic rare CNV. Two of the 
four patients in this study had environmental risk factors that may have been 
involved in the development of SCZ.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case series suggest that a genetic cohort study 
would be useful for evaluating which genetic and environmental risk factors 
could better explain the variable expressivity of 16p13.11 duplication. 
Furthermore, this work could be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of 
SCZ.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Pathologic myopia (PM) is a major cause of severe visual 
impairment and blindness, and current applications of artificial intelligence 
(AI) have covered the diagnosis and classification of PM. This meta-analysis and 
systematic review aimed to evaluate the overall performance of AI-based models 
in detecting PM and related complications.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore for 
eligible studies before Dec 20, 2022. The methodological quality of included 
studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy 
Studies (QUADAS-2). We calculated the pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity 
(SPE) and the summary area under the curve (AUC) using a random effects model, 
to evaluate the performance of AI in the detection of PM based on fundus or 
optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.
RESULTS: 22 studies were included in the systematic review, and 14 of them were 
included in the quantitative analysis. Of all included studies, SEN and SPE 
ranged from 80.0% to 98.7% and from 79.5% to 100.0% for PM detection, 
respectively. For the detection of PM, the summary AUC was 0.99 (95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.97 to 0.99), and the pooled SEN and SPE were 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 
to 0.96) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.98), respectively. For the detection of 
PM-related choroid neovascularization (CNV), the summary AUC was 0.99 (95% CI: 
0.97 to 0.99).
CONCLUSION: Our review demonstrated the excellent performance of current AI 
algorithms in detecting PM and related complications based on fundus and OCT 
images.

Fetal hyperechogenic kidneys (HEK) is etiologically a heterogeneous disorder. 
The aim of this study was to identify the genetic causes of HEK using prenatal 
chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and exome sequencing (ES). From June 2014 
to September 2022, we identified 92 HEK fetuses detected by ultrasound. We 
reviewed and documented other ultrasound anomalies, microscopic and 
submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities, and single gene disorders. We also 
analyzed the diagnostic yield of CMA and ES and the clinical impact the 
diagnosis had on pregnancy management. In our cohort, CMA detected 27 pathogenic 
copy number variations (CNVs) in 25 (25/92, 27.2%) fetuses, with the most common 
CNV being 17q12 microdeletion syndrome. Among the 26 fetuses who underwent 
further ES testing, we identified 7 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants and 8 
variants of uncertain significance in 9 genes in 12 fetuses. Four novel variants 
were first reported herein, expanding the mutational spectra for HEK-related 
genes. Following counseling, 52 families chose to continue the pregnancy, and in 
23 of them, postnatal ultrasound showed no detectable renal abnormalities. Of 
these 23 cases, 15 had isolated HEK on prenatal ultrasound. Taken together, our 
study showed a high rate of detectable genetic etiologies in cases with fetal 
HEK at the levels of chromosomal (aneuploidy), sub-chromosomal 
(microdeletions/microduplications), and single gene (point mutations). 
Therefore, we speculate that combined CMA and ES testing for fetal HEK is 
feasible and has good clinical utility. When no genetic abnormalities are 
identified, the findings can be transient, especially in the isolated HEK group.

BACKGROUND: Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) can detect copy number variants 
(CNV) beyond the resolution of standard G-banded karyotyping. De novo or 
inherited microdeletions may cause autosomal dominant movement disorders.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical 
characteristics, associated features, and genetic information of children with 
deletions in known genes that cause movement disorders and to make 
recommendations regarding the diagnostic application of CMA.
METHODS: Clinical cases published in English were identified in scientific 
databases (PubMed, ClinVar, and DECIPHER) from January 1998 to July 2019 
following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
guidelines. Cases with deletions or microdeletions greater than 300 kb were 
selected. Information collected included age, sex, movement disorders, 
associated features, and the size and location of the deletion. Duplications or 
microduplications were not included.
RESULTS: A total of 18.097 records were reviewed, and 171 individuals were 
identified. Ataxia (30.4%), stereotypies (23.9%), and dystonia (21%) were the 
most common movement disorders. A total of 16% of the patients demonstrated more 
than one movement disorder. The most common associated features were 
intellectual disability or developmental delay (78.9%) and facial dysmorphism 
(57.8%). The majority (77.7%) of microdeletions were smaller than 5 Mb. We find 
no correlation between movement disorders, their associated features, and the 
size of microdeletions.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of CMA as an investigational test in 
children with movement disorders. As the majority of identified articles were 
case reports and small case series (low quality), future efforts should focus on 
larger prospective studies to examine the causation of microdeletions in 
pediatric movement disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the additional diagnostic value of CNV-seq over 
conventional karyotyping on the part of chromosomal abnormalities in prenatal 
diagnosis.
METHOD: This was a systematic review conducted in accordance with PRISMA 
criteria. In order to clarify related research, PubMed, Web of Science databases 
(including Core Collection, BIOSIS Previews, MEDLINE, and so on), The Cochrane 
Library and Wiley Online Library were searched with the terms: "prenatal 
diagnosis," "CNV-seq," "karyotyping," published from January 2010 to May 2022. 
No language restrictions. RenMan 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Eight studies were included in this systemic review and meta-analysis, 
including 11 091 pregnant women with high-risk pregnancy factors or with 
structurally abnormal fetus under ultrasound. CNV-seq detected a 2% (95% CI, -0% 
to 4%) additional chromosomal anomalies over conventional karyotyping in the six 
series. A 4% (95% CI, 3%-6%) pooled mean incremental yield of pathogenic CNVs by 
CNV-seq over karyotyping was observed, with a 1%-16% range.
CONCLUSION: CNV-seq, applied in prenatal diagnosis, may detect more chromosomal 
abnormalities when compared with karyotyping. With the advantages of wide 
coverage, high throughput, high resolution, no culture, good compatibility, and 
adjustable sequencing depth, CNV-seq has high application value in prenatal 
diagnosis.

Background: Luscan-Lumish syndrome is characterized by macrocephaly, postnatal 
overgrowth, intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), which is 
caused by heterozygous SETD2 (SET domain containing 2) mutations. The incidence 
of Luscan-Lumish syndrome is unclear. The study was conducted to provide a novel 
pathogenic SETD2 variant causing atypical Luscan-Lumish syndrome and review all 
the published SETD2 mutations and corresponding symptoms, comprehensively 
understanding the phenotypes and genotypes of SETD2 mutations. Methods: 
Peripheral blood samples of the proband and his parents were collected for 
next-generation sequencing including whole-exome sequencing (WES), copy number 
variation (CNV) detection and mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Identified variant 
was verified by Sanger sequencing. Conservative analysis and structural analysis 
were performed to investigate the effect of mutation. Public databases such as 
PubMed, Clinvar and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) were used to collect all 
cases with SETD2 mutations. Results: A novel pathogenic SETD2 variant 
(c.5835_c.5836insAGAA, p. A1946Rfs*2) was identified in a Chinese 3-year-old 
boy, who had speech and motor delay without overgrowth. Conservative analysis 
and structural analysis showed that the novel pathogenic variant would loss the 
conserved domains in the C-terminal region and result in loss of function of 
SETD2 protein. Frameshift mutations and non-sense mutations account for 68.5% of 
the total 51 SETD2 point mutations, suggesting that Luscan-Lumish syndrome is 
likely due to loss of function of SETD2. But we failed to find an association 
between genotype and phenotype of SETD2 mutations. Conclusion: Our findings 
expand the genotype-phenotype knowledge of SETD2-associated neurological 
disorder and provide new evidence for further genetic counselling.

Copy number variants (CNVs), comprising gene amplifications and deletions, are a 
pervasive class of heritable variation. CNVs play a key role in rapid adaptation 
in both natural, and experimental, evolution. However, despite the advent of new 
DNA sequencing technologies, detection and quantification of CNVs in 
heterogeneous populations has remained challenging. Here, we summarize recent 
advances in the use of CNV reporters that provide a facile means of quantifying 
de novo CNVs at a specific locus in the genome, and nanopore sequencing, for 
resolving the often complex structures of CNVs. We provide guidance for the 
engineering and analysis of CNV reporters and practical guidelines for 
single-cell analysis of CNVs using flow cytometry. We summarize recent advances 
in nanopore sequencing, discuss the utility of this technology, and provide 
guidance for the bioinformatic analysis of these data to define the molecular 
structure of CNVs. The combination of reporter systems for tracking and 
isolating CNV lineages and long-read DNA sequencing for characterizing CNV 
structures enables unprecedented resolution of the mechanisms by which CNVs are 
generated and their evolutionary dynamics.

Differences of sex development (DSDs) are a group of congenital conditions 
characterized by a discrepancy between chromosomal, gonadal, and genital sex 
development of an individual, with significant impact on medical, psychological 
and reproductive life. The genetic heterogeneity of DSDs complicates the 
diagnosis and almost half of the patients remains undiagnosed. In this context, 
chromosomal imbalances in syndromic DSD patients may help to identify new genes 
implicated in DSDs. In this study, we aimed at describing the burden of 
chromosomal imbalances including submicroscopic ones (copy number variants or 
CNVs) in a cohort of prenatal syndromic DSD patients, and review their role in 
DSDs. Our patients carried at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
chromosomal imbalance/CNV or low-level mosaicism for aneuploidy. Almost half of 
the cases resulted from an unbalanced chromosomal rearrangement. Chromosome 
9p/q, 4p/q, 3q and 11q anomalies were more frequently observed. Review of the 
literature confirmed the causative role of CNVs in DSDs, either in disruption of 
known DSD-causing genes (SOX9, NR0B1, NR5A1, AR, ATRX, …) or as a tool to 
suspect new genes in DSDs (HOXD cluster, ADCY2, EMX2, CAMK1D, …). Recurrent CNVs 
of regulatory elements without coding sequence content (i.e. 
duplications/deletions upstream of SOX3 or SOX9) confirm detection of CNVs as a 
mean to explore our non-coding genome. Thus, CNV detection remains a powerful 
tool to explore undiagnosed DSDs, either through routine techniques or through 
emerging technologies such as long-read whole genome sequencing or optical 
genome mapping.

BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a clinically heterogeneous hereditary 
connective tissue disorder. Severe cardiovascular manifestations (i.e., aortic 
aneurysm and dissection) are the most life-threatening complications. Most of 
the cases are caused by mutations, a minor group of which are copy number 
variations (CNV), in the FBN1 gene.
METHODS: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification test was performed to 
detect CNVs in 41 MFS patients not carrying disease-causing mutations in FBN1 
gene. Moreover, the association was analyzed between the localization of CNVs, 
the affected regulatory elements and the cardiovascular phenotypes among all 
cases known from the literature.
RESULTS: A large two-exon deletion (exon 46 and 47) was identified in two 
related patients, which was associated with a mild form of cardiovascular 
phenotype. Severe cardiovascular symptoms were found significantly more frequent 
in patients with FBN1 large deletion compared to our patients with intragenic 
small scale FBN1 mutation. Bioinformatic data analyses of regulatory elements 
located within the FBN1 gene revealed an association between the deletion of 
STAT3 transcription factor-binding site and cardiovascular symptoms in five out 
of 25 patients.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that large CNVs are often associated with 
severe cardiovascular manifestations in MFS and the localization of these CNVs 
affect the phenotype severity.

Introduction: Molecular analysis plays a growing role in the diagnosis of 
mesenchymal neoplasms. The aim of this study was to retrospectively apply broad, 
multiplex molecular assays (a solid tumor targeted next-generation sequencing 
[NGS]) assay and single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] microarray) to selected 
tumors, exploring the current utility and limitations. Methods: We searched our 
database (2010-2020) for diagnostically challenging mesenchymal neoplasms. After 
histologic review of available slides, tissue blocks were selected for NGS, SNP 
microarray, or both. DNA and RNA were extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE 
Kit Protocol on the QIAcube instrument. The NGS platform used was the TruSight 
Tumor 170 (TST-170). For SNP array, copy number variant (CNV) analysis was 
performed using the OncoScanTM CNV Plus Assay. Results: DNA/RNA was successfully 
extracted from 50% of tumors (n = 10/20). Specimens not successfully extracted 
included 6 core biopsies, 3 incisional biopsies, and 1 resection; 4 were 
decalcified (3 hydrochloric acid, 1 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Higher 
tumor proportion and number of tumor cells were parameters positively associated 
with sufficient DNA/RNA extraction whereas necrosis and decalcification were 
negatively associated with sufficient extraction. Molecular testing helped reach 
a definitive diagnosis in 50% of tumors (n = 5/10). Conclusions: Although the 
overall utility of this approach is limited, these molecular panels can be 
helpful in detecting a specific "driver" alteration.

BACKGROUND: Copy number variation (CNV) has become widely recognized in recent 
years due to the extensive use of gene screening in developmental disorders and 
epilepsy research. 1q21.1 microduplication syndrome is a rare CNV disease that 
can manifest as multiple congenital developmental disorders, autism spectrum 
disorders, congenital malformations, and congenital heart defects with genetic 
heterogeneity.
CASE SUMMARY: We reported a pediatric patient with 1q21.1 microduplication 
syndrome, and carried out a literature review to determine the correlation 
between 1q21.1 microduplication and its phenotypes. We summarized the patient's 
medical history and clinical symptoms, and extracted genomic DNA from the 
patient, her parents, elder brother, and sister. The patient was an 8-mo-old 
girl who was hospitalized for recurrent convulsions over a 2-mo period. Whole 
exon sequencing and whole genome low-depth sequencing (CNV-seq) were then 
performed. Whole exon sequencing detected a 1.58-Mb duplication in the 
CHR1:145883867-147465312 region, which was located in the 1q21.1 region. Family 
analysis showed that the pathogenetic duplication fragment, which was also 
detected in her elder brother's DNA originated from the mother.
CONCLUSION: Whole exon sequencing combined with quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction can provide an accurate molecular diagnosis in children with 1q21.1 
microduplication syndrome, which is of great significance for genetic counseling 
and early intervention.

Thalassemia is one of the most heterogeneous diseases, with more than a thousand 
mutation types recorded worldwide. Molecular diagnosis of thalassemia by 
conventional PCR-based DNA analysis is time- and resource-consuming owing to the 
phenotype variability, disease complexity, and molecular diagnostic test 
limitations. Moreover, genetic counseling must be backed-up by an extensive 
diagnosis of the thalassemia-causing phenotype and the possible genetic 
modifiers. Data coming from advanced molecular techniques such as targeted 
sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing 
(TGS) are more appropriate and valuable for DNA analysis of thalassemia. While 
NGS is superior at variant calling to TGS thanks to its lower error rates, the 
longer reads nature of the TGS permits haplotype-phasing that is superior for 
variant discovery on the homologous genes and CNV calling. The emergence of many 
cutting-edge machine learning-based bioinformatics tools has improved the 
accuracy of variant and CNV calling. Constant improvement of these sequencing 
and bioinformatics will enable precise thalassemia detections, especially for 
the CNV and the homologous HBA and HBG genes. In conclusion, laboratory 
transiting from conventional DNA analysis to NGS or TGS and following the 
guidelines towards a single assay will contribute to a better diagnostics 
approach of thalassemia.

Over the years, increasing evidence has shown that copy number variations (CNVs) 
play an important role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of Colorectal Cancer 
(CRC). Colorectal adenomas are highly prevalent lesions, but only 5% of these 
adenomas ever progress to carcinoma. This review summarizes the different CNVs 
associated with adenoma-carcinoma CRC progression and with CRC staging. 
Characterization of CNVs in circulating free-RNA and in blood-derived exosomes 
augers well with the potential of using such assays for patient management and 
early detection of metastasis. To overcome the limitations related to tissue 
biopsies and tumor heterogeneity, using CNVs to characterize tumor-derived 
materials in biofluids provides less invasive sampling methods and a sample that 
collectively represents multiple tumor sites in heterogeneous samples. Liquid 
biopsies provide a source of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor 
cells (CTCs), tumor-derived exosomes (TDE), circulating free RNA, and non-coding 
RNA. This review provides an overview of the current diagnostic and predictive 
models from liquid biopsies.

OBJECTIVE: In-utero repair of open neural tube defects (ONTD) is an accepted 
treatment option with demonstrated superior outcome for eligible patients. While 
current guidelines recommend genetic testing by chromosomal microarray analysis 
(CMA) when a major congenital anomaly is detected prenatally, the requirement 
for an in-utero repair, based on the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) 
criteria, is a normal karyotype. In this study, we aimed to evaluate if CMA 
should be recommended as a prerequisite for in-utero ONTD repair.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of pregnancies complicated by 
ONTD that underwent laparotomy-assisted fetoscopic repair or open-hysterotomy 
fetal surgery at a single tertiary center between September 2011 and July 2021. 
All patients met the MOMS eligibility criteria and had a normal karyotype. In a 
subset of the pregnancies (n = 77), CMA testing was also conducted. We reviewed 
the CMA results and divided the cohort into two groups according to whether 
clinically reportable copy-number variants (CNV) were detected (reportable-CNV 
group) or not (normal-CMA group). Surgical characteristics, complications, and 
maternal and early neonatal outcomes were compared between the two groups. The 
primary outcomes were fetal or neonatal death, hydrocephalus, motor function at 
12 months of age and walking status at 30 months of age. Standard parametric and 
non-parametric statistical tests were employed as appropriate.
RESULTS: During the study period, 146 fetuses with ONTD were eligible for and 
underwent in-utero repair. CMA results were available for 77 (52.7%) patients. 
Of those, 65 (84%) had a normal CMA and 12 (16%) had a reportable CNV, two of 
which were classified as pathogenic. The first case with a pathogenic CNV was 
diagnosed with a 749-kb central 22q11.21 deletion spanning low-copy-repeat 
regions B-D of chromosome 22; the second case was diagnosed with a 1.3-Mb 
interstitial deletion at 1q21.1q21.2. Maternal demographics, clinical 
characteristics, operative data and postoperative complications were similar 
between those with normal CMA results and those with reportable CNVs. There were 
no significant differences in gestational age at delivery or any obstetric and 
early neonatal outcome between the study groups. Motor function at birth and at 
12 months of age, and walking status at 30 months of age, were similar between 
the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Standard diagnostic testing with CMA should be offered when an ONTD 
is detected prenatally, as this approach has implications for counseling 
regarding prognosis and recurrence risk. Our results indicate that the presence 
of a clinically reportable CNV should not a priori affect eligibility for 
in-utero repair, as overall pregnancy outcome is similar in these cases to that 
of cases with normal CMA. Nevertheless, significant CMA results will require a 
case-by-case multidisciplinary discussion to evaluate eligibility. To generalize 
the conclusion of this single-center series, a larger, multicenter long-term 
study should be considered. © 2023 International Society of Ultrasound in

BACKGROUND: This paper evaluated the clinical utility of massively parallel 
sequencing-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for detecting trisomy 21 
(T21), T18, T13, sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCA), and rare chromosome 
aneuploidies (RCA) among the data collected by a clinical laboratory in southern 
China.
METHODS: In a 3-year period between January 2017 and December 2019, over 40,000 
pregnant women underwent NIPT clinical screening test for fetal T21, T18, T13, 
SCA, and RCA in our laboratory. NIPT samples were processed using the NextSeq 
CN500 platform. The positive results were confirmed by karyotyping, and 
chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or copy number variants (CNV) sequencing. 
Details of the pregnancy outcomes were collected via telephone interview.
RESULTS: NIPT results were available for 41,819 cases; 691 positive cases were 
reported. The overall sensitivity for detection of T21, T18, T13, SCA, and RCA 
was 99.21, 100.00, 100.00, 98.55, and 100.00%, and the specificity was 99.95, 
99.94, 99.98, 99.69, and 99.92%, respectively. The positive predictive values 
(PPVs) for detection of T21, T18, T13, SCA, and RCA were 85.62, 45.24, 40.00, 
34.17, and 13.51%, respectively, and those for detection of 45,X, 47,XXY, 
47,XXX, 47,XYY, and 46,XY(delX) 20.00, 59.18, 28.95, 61.54, and 25.00%, 
respectively. Regarding pregnancy outcomes, 92.38% of the pregnancies with 
confirmed aneuploidies were terminated, and 91.20% of those identified as having 
a false-positive result were carried to term. Among 252 unconfirmed cases, 
24.60% of the pregnancies were terminated and 38.10% carried to term, while 
37.30% declined interview.
CONCLUSIONS: NIPT is widely used to screen fetal aneuploidies based on its high 
sensitivity and specificity. However, in this study, the PPVs of NIPT in terms 
of detecting T18, T13, XO, XXX and RCA were < 50%. In addition, more than 
one-third of NIPT-positive women did not accept invasive prenatal diagnosis. 
Confirmatory diagnosis is strongly recommended for women with positive NIPT 
outcomes before any further decision is made.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and genetic features of a child with 
autosomal dominant mental retardation type 40 (MRD40) due to variant of the 
CHAMP1 gene.
METHODS: Clinical characteristics of the child were analyzed. Genetic testing 
was carried out by low-depth high-throughput and whole genome copy number 
variant sequencing (CNV-seq) and whole exome sequencing (WES). A literature 
review was also carried out for the clinical phenotype and genetic 
characteristics of patients with MRD40 due to CHAMP1 gene variants.
RESULTS: The child, a 11-month-old girl, has presented with intellectual and 
motor developmental delay. CNV-seq revealed no definite pathogenic variants. WES 
has detected the presence of a heterozygous c.1908C>G (p.Y636*) variant in the 
CHAMP1 gene, which was carried by neither parent and predicted to be pathogenic. 
Literature review has identified 33 additional children from 12 previous 
reports. All children had presented with developmental delay and mental 
retardation, and most had dystonia (94.1%), delayed speech and/or walking 
(85.2%, 82.4%) and ocular abnormalities (79.4%). In total 26 variants of the 
CHAMP1 gene were detected, with all nonsense variants being of loss-of-function 
type, located in exon 3, and de novo in origin.
CONCLUSION: The heterozygous c.1908C>G (p.Y636*) variant of the CHAMP1 gene 
probably underlay the WRD40 in this child. Genetic testing should be considered 
for children featuring global developmental delay, mental retardation, 
hypertonia and facial dysmorphism.

In this review we discuss epigenetic disorders that result from aberrations in 
genes linked to epigenetic regulation. We describe current testing methods for 
the detection of copy number variants (CNVs) in Mendelian disorders, dosage 
sensitivity, reciprocal phenotypes and the challenges of test selection and 
overlapping clinical features in genetic diagnosis. We discuss aberrations of 
DNA methylation and propose a role for episignatures as a novel clinical testing 
method in CNV disorders. Finally, we postulate that episignature mapping in CNV 
disorders may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease 
and unlock key findings of the genome-wide impact on disease gene networks.

Microcephaly presents heterogeneous genetic etiology linked to several 
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Copy number variants (CNVs) are a causal 
mechanism of microcephaly whose investigation is a crucial step for unraveling 
its molecular basis. Our purpose was to investigate the burden of rare CNVs in 
microcephalic individuals and to review genes and CNV syndromes associated with 
microcephaly. We performed chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) in 185 
Brazilian patients with microcephaly and evaluated microcephalic patients 
carrying < 200 kb CNVs documented in the DECIPHER database. Additionally, we 
reviewed known genes and CNV syndromes causally linked to microcephaly through 
the PubMed, OMIM, DECIPHER, and ClinGen databases. Rare clinically relevant CNVs 
were detected in 39 out of the 185 Brazilian patients investigated by CMA (21%). 
In 31 among the 60 DECIPHER patients carrying < 200 kb CNVs, at least one known 
microcephaly gene was observed. Overall, four gene sets implicated in 
microcephaly were disclosed: known microcephaly genes; genes with supporting 
evidence of association with microcephaly; known macrocephaly genes; and novel 
candidates, including OTUD7A, BBC3, CNTN6, and NAA15. In the review, we compiled 
957 known microcephaly genes and 58 genomic CNV loci, comprising 13 duplications 
and 50 deletions, which have already been associated with clinical findings 
including microcephaly. We reviewed genes and CNV syndromes previously 
associated with microcephaly, reinforced the high CMA diagnostic yield for this 
condition, pinpointed novel candidate loci linked to microcephaly deserving 
further evaluation, and provided a useful resource for future research on the 
field of neurodevelopment.

Abnormal hypothalamic/posterior pituitary development appears to be a major 
determinant of pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS). The observation of 
familial cases and associated congenital abnormalities suggests a genetic basis. 
Single-gene mutations explain less than 5% of the cases, and whole exome 
sequencing has shown heterogeneous results. The present study aimed to assess 
copy number variation (CNV) using array-based comparative genomic hybridization 
(aCGH) in patients with non-syndromic PSIS and comprehensively review data from 
the literature on CNV analysis in congenital hypopituitarism (CH) patients. 
Twenty-one patients with sporadic CH from our outpatient clinics presented with 
ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP) and no central nervous system abnormalities on 
magnetic resonance image (MRI) or any other malformations on physical 
examination at presentation were enrolled in the study. aCGH using a 
whole-genome customized 400K oligonucleotide platform was performed in our 
patients. For the literature review, we searched for case reports of patients 
with CH and CNV detected by either karyotype or aCGH reported in PubMed up to 
November 2021. Thirty-five distinct rare CNVs were observed in 18 patients (86%) 
and two of them (6%) were classified as pathogenic: one deletion of 1.8 Mb in 
chromosome 17 (17q12) and one deletion of 15 Mb in chromosome 18 
(18p11.32p11.21), each one in a distinct patient. In the literature review, 67 
pathogenic CNVs were published in 83 patients with CH, including the present 
study. Most of these patients had EPP (78% out of the 45 evaluated by sellar 
MRI) and were syndromic (70%). The most frequently affected chromosomes were X, 
18, 20 and 1. Our study has found that CNV can be a mechanism of genetic 
abnormality in non-syndromic patients with CH and EPP. In future studies, one or 
more genes in those CNVs, both pathogenic and variant of uncertain significance, 
may be considered as good candidate genes.

OBJECTIVES: Adenocarcinoma at the gastroesophageal junction (ACGEJ) refers to a 
malignant tumor that occurs at the esophagogastric junction. Despite some 
progress in targeted therapies for HER2, FGFR2, EGFR, MET, Claudin 18.2 and 
immune checkpoints in ACGEJ tumors, the 5-year survival rate of patients remains 
poor. Thus, it is urgent to explore genomic alterations and neoantigen 
characteristics of tumors and identify CD8+ T-cell infiltration-associated genes 
to find potential therapeutic targets and develop a risk model to predict ACGEJ 
patients' overall survival (OS).
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on 55 paired samples from 
Chinese ACGEJ patients. Somatic mutations and copy number variations were 
detected by Strelka2 and FACETS, respectively. SigProfiler and SciClone were 
employed to decipher the mutation signature and clonal structure of each sample, 
respectively. Neoantigens were predicted using the MuPeXI pipeline. RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) data of ACGEJ samples from our previous studies and The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to identify genes significantly associated 
with CD8+ T-cell infiltration by weighted gene coexpression network analysis 
(WGCNA). To construct a risk model, we conducted LASSO and univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS: Recurrent MAP2K7, RNF43 and RHOA mutations were found in ACGEJ tumors. 
The COSMIC signature SBS17 was associated with ACGEJ progression. CCNE1 and 
VEGFA were identified as putative CNV driver genes. PI3KCA and TP53 mutations 
conferred selective advantages to cancer cells. The Chinese ACGEJ patient 
neoantigen landscape was revealed for the first time, and 58 potential 
neoantigens common to TSNAdb and IEDB were identified. Compared with Siewert 
type II samples, Siewert type III samples had significant enrichment of the 
SBS17 signature, a lower TNFRSF14 copy number, a higher proportion of samples 
with complex clonal architecture and a higher neoantigen load. We identified 10 
important CD8+ T-cell infiltration-related Hub genes (CCL5, CD2, CST7, GVINP1, 
GZMK, IL2RB, IKZF3, PLA2G2D, P2RY10 and ZAP70) as potential therapeutic targets 
from the RNA-seq data. Seven CD8+ T-cell infiltration-related genes (ADAM28, 
ASPH, CAMK2N1, F2R, STAP1, TP53INP2, ZC3H3) were selected to construct a 
prognostic model. Patients classified as high risk based on this model had 
significantly worse OS than low-risk patients, which was replicated in the 
TCGA-ACGEJ cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new neoantigen-based immunotherapeutic targets 
for ACGEJ treatment and effective disease prognosis biomarkers.

Copy number variants (CNVs) represent major etiologic factors in rare genetic 
diseases. Current clinical CNV interpretation workflows require extensive 
back-and-forth with multiple tools and databases. This increases complexity and 
time burden, potentially resulting in missed genetic diagnoses. We present the 
Suite for CNV Interpretation and Prioritization (SCIP), a software package for 
the clinical interpretation of CNVs detected by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). 
The SCIP Visualization Module near-instantaneously displays all information 
necessary for CNV interpretation (variant quality, population frequency, 
inheritance pattern, and clinical relevance) on a single page-supported by 
modules providing variant filtration and prioritization. SCIP was 
comprehensively evaluated using WGS data from 1027 families with congenital 
cardiac disease and/or autism spectrum disorder, containing 187 pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic (P/LP) CNVs identified in previous curations. SCIP was 
efficient in filtration and prioritization: a median of just two CNVs per case 
were selected for review, yet it captured all P/LP findings (92.5% of which 
ranked 1st). SCIP was also able to identify one pathogenic CNV previously 
missed. SCIP was benchmarked against AnnotSV and a spreadsheet-based manual 
workflow and performed superiorly than both. In conclusion, SCIP is a novel 
software package for efficient clinical CNV interpretation, substantially faster 
and more accurate than previous tools (available at https://github.com/qd29/SCIP 
, a video tutorial series is available at https://bit.ly/SCIPVideos ).

Copy number variation (CNV), as one of the important variations in the 
biological genome, refers to the deletion and duplication of genomic segments 
between 1 kb and 50 kb caused by genomic rearrangements. Currently, many copy 
number variations have been found to be significantly associated with important 
economic traits such as growth, development and reproduction of cattle. However, 
the study of MUC19 gene has not been reported. In this study, we detected an 
appropriate correlation between MUC19 gene and growth traits of Chinese cattle. 
We detected the distribution of MUC19-CNV across Qinchuan cattle (QC), Pinan 
cattle (PN), Xianan cattle (XN), Yunling cattle (YL), Guyuan cattle (GY), 
Jiaxian cattle (JX), and analyzed the association between types of MUC19-CNV and 
growth traits through SPSS20.0 software and method of ANOVA. The results showed 
that various types of CNV were present in each breed of cattle, but there were 
discrepancies in the distribution of copy number variant types. The Association 
analysis result showed that CNV of MUC19 gene showed a postive effect in cattle 
growth traits: the copy number of MUC19 was significantly correlated with hip 
width of PN cattle (P < 0.01), height at hip cross and withers height of PN 
cattle (P < 0.05), hip width and body length of JX cattle (P < 0.05), Huckle 
bone width of YL cattle (P < 0.05).

Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a multiplex copy 
number analysis tool which is routinely used to detect large mutations in 
genetic diseases. With continuous modifications, MLPA has been extended for the 
detection of DNA methylation variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms, 
chromosome abnormalities and other forms of genomic variation. The combination 
with other techniques has even enlarged the application of MLPA in molecular 
diagnostics of various human diseases. In this review, the principle of 
MLPA-based techniques as well as their main and latest applications in clinical 
detection are described. It is believed that with improved automation, increased 
multiplexing, lower cost and the combination with other technologies, MLPA will 
play an increasingly important role in molecular diagnosis of human disease.

RATIONALE: Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome (BBSOAS) is a rare 
neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function variants in the Nuclear 
Receptor Subfamily 2 Group F Member 1 (NR2F1). Here, we report a case of fetal 
BBSOAS. The fetus is typically featured by bilateral ventricle widening in the 
late second trimester, meanwhile, a 7.94-Mb deletion fragment on 5q14.3q15 
involving the whole NR2F1 gene was confirmed by copy number variation sequencing 
(CNV-Seq) combined with karyotyping analysis. Our aim is to provide 
comprehensive prenatal clinical management strategy for fetal BBSOAS.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 29-year-old primipara and her husband were referred to our 
prenatal diagnosis center due to the widening of bilateral ventricles at 29 + 1 
weeks of gestation age.
DIAGNOSES: Ultrasound revealed the fetal widening posterior horns of bilateral 
ventricles at the GA of 27 + 3 weeks, 11 mm on the left and 10 mm on the right. 
At the following 29 + 1 weeks, ultrasound showed the posterior horn of the left 
lateral ventricle: 12 mm while the width of the right decreased to 9 mm, and 
intracranial arachnoid cyst. Furthermore, MRI confirmed that intracranial cyst 
might originate from an enlarged cisterna venae magnae cerebri, with mild 
dilation of 13.5 mm on the left ventricle. The fetal karyotyping analysis and 
CNV-Seq detection confirmed a 7.94-Mb deleted fragment on 5q14.3q15 
(89340000_97280000) through the amniocentesis at 29 + 4 weeks of GA.
INTERVENTIONS: The fetus was closely monitored and underwent the following 
assessment by the multidisciplinary team.
OUTCOMES: The pregnancy was terminated in the end.
LESSONS: It is vital to use molecular and cytogenetical detections combined with 
a dynamic development history to make a definite diagnosis and evaluate the 
genetic status for the fetuses with BBSOAS.

Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with 
complete penetrance affecting the macula. This is caused by a mutation in the 
TIMP-3. This objective narrative review aims to provide an overview of the 
pathophysiology, current treatment modalities, and future perspectives. A 
literature search was performed using "PubMed," "Web of Science," "Scopus," 
"ScienceDirect," "Google Scholar," "medRxiv," and "bioRxiv." The molecular 
mechanisms underlying SFD are not completely understood. Novel advancements in 
cell culture techniques, including induced pluripotent stem cells, may enable 
more reliable modeling of SFD. These cell culture techniques aim to shed more 
light on the pathophysiology of SFD, and hopefully, this may lead to the future 
development of treatment strategies for SFD. Currently, no gene therapy is 
available. The main treatment is the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth 
factors (anti-VEGF) to treat secondary choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV), 
which is a major complication observed in this condition. If CNV is detected and 
treated promptly, patients with SFD have a good chance of maintaining a 
functional central vision. Other treatment modalities have been tried but have 
shown limited benefit, and therefore, have not managed to be more widely 
accepted. In summary, although there is no definitive cure yet, the use of 
anti-VEGF treatment for secondary CNV has provided the opportunity to maintain 
functional vision in individuals with SFD, provided CNV is detected and treated 
early.

BACKGROUND: Congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) are 
the most common cause of chronic kidney disease among children and adults 
younger than 30 yr. In our previous study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
identified a known monogenic cause of isolated or syndromic CAKUT in 13% of 
families with CAKUT. However, WES has limitations and detection of copy number 
variations (CNV) is technically challenging, and CNVs causative of CAKUT have 
previously been detected in up to 16% of cases.
OBJECTIVE: To detect CNVs causing CAKUT in this WES cohort and increase the 
diagnostic yield.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a genome-wide single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP)-based CNV analysis on the same CAKUT cohort for whom WES was 
previously conducted.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated and classified the 
CNVs using previously published predefined criteria.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In a cohort of 170 CAKUT families, we detected a 
pathogenic CNV known to cause CAKUT in nine families (5.29%, 9/170). There were 
no competing variants on genome-wide CNV analysis or WES analysis. In addition, 
we identified novel likely pathogenic CNVs that may cause a CAKUT phenotype in 
three of the 170 families (1.76%).
CONCLUSIONS: CNV analysis in this cohort of 170 CAKUT families previously 
examined via WES increased the rate of diagnosis of genetic causes of CAKUT from 
13% on WES to 18% on WES + CNV analysis combined. We also identified three 
candidate loci that may potentially cause CAKUT.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We conducted a genetics study on families with congenital 
anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). We identified gene mutations 
that can explain CAKUT symptoms in 5.29% of the families, which increased the 
percentage of genetic causes of CAKUT to 18% from a previous study, so roughly 
one in five of our patients with CAKUT had a genetic cause. These analyses can 
help patients with CAKUT and their families in identifying a possible genetic 
cause.

Genetic kidney disease comprises a diverse group of disorders. These can roughly 
be divided in the phenotype groups congenital anomalies of the kidney and 
urinary tract, ciliopathies, glomerulopathies, stone disorders, 
tubulointerstitial kidney disease, and tubulopathies. Many etiologies can lead 
to chronic kidney disease that can progress to end-stage kidney disease. Despite 
each individual disease being rare, together these genetic disorders account for 
a large proportion of kidney disease cases. With the introduction of massively 
parallel sequencing, genetic testing has become more accessible, but a 
comprehensive analysis of the diagnostic yield is lacking. This review gives an 
overview of the diagnostic yield of genetic testing across and within the full 
range of kidney disease phenotypes through a systematic literature search that 
resulted in 115 included articles. Patient, test, and cohort characteristics 
that can influence the diagnostic yield are highlighted. Detection of copy 
number variations and their contribution to the diagnostic yield is described 
for all phenotype groups. Also, the impact of a genetic diagnosis for a patient 
and family members, which can be diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic, is 
shown through the included articles. This review will allow clinicians to 
estimate an a priori probability of finding a genetic cause for the kidney 
disease in their patients.

INTRODUCTION: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) elucidates the diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) genetic characteristics by finding recurrent and novel 
somatic mutations. This observational study attempted to create an NGS 
panel with a focus on identifying novel somatic mutations which could have 
potential clinical and therapeutic implications. This panel was created to look 
for mutations in 133 genes chosen on basis of a literature review and it was 
used to sequence the tumor DNA of 20 DLBCL patients after a centralized 
histopathologic review.
METHODS: The study included 20 patients having DLBCL. The quality and quantity 
of tumor cells were accessed by H&E staining and correlated with histopathology 
and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) status. Patients were grouped as ABC (activated 
B-cell), PMBL (primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma), and other or 
unclassified subtypes. The lymphoma panel of 133 was designed on targeted 
sequencing of multiple genes for the coding regions through NGS. The libraries 
were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina platform. The alignment of 
obtained sequences was performed using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and 
identification of somatic mutations was done using LoFreq (version 2) variant 
caller. The mutations were annotated using an annotation pipeline (VariMAT). 
Previously published literature and databases were used for the annotation of 
clinically relevant mutations. The common variants were filtered for reporting 
based on the presence in various population databases (1000G, ExAC, EVS, 
1000Japanese, dbSNP, UK10K, MedVarDb). A custom read-depth-based algorithm was 
used to determine CNV (Copy Number Variants) from targeted sequencing 
experiments. Rare CNVs were detected using a comparison of the test data 
read-depths with the matched reference dataset. Reportable mutations were 
prioritized and prepared based on AMP-ASCO-CAP (Association for Molecular 
Pathology-American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American 
Pathologists), WHO guidelines, and also based on annotation metrics from OncoMD 
(a knowledge base of genomic alterations).
RESULTS: The informativity of the panel was 95 percent. NOTCH 1 was the most 
frequently mutated gene in 16.1% of patients followed by 12.9% who had ARID1A 
mutations. MYD88 and TP53 mutations were detected in 9.6% of the patient while 
6.4% of patients had CSF3R mutations. NOTCH 1 and TP 53 are the most frequently 
reported gene in the middle age group (40-60). Mutation in MYD88 is reported in 
every age group. MYD88 (51%) is the most common mutation in ABC subtypes of 
DLBCL, followed by NOTCH 1 (44%) and SOCS 1 (33%) according to our 
findings. NOTCH 1 mutations are frequent in ABC and PMBL subtypes. Closer 
investigation reveals missense mutation is the most frequent mutation observed 
in the total cohort targeting 68.4% followed by frameshift deletion reported in 
26.3%. Six novel variants have been discovered in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the high yield of information in DLBCL 
using the NGS Lymphoma panel. Results also highlight the molecular heterogeneity 
of DLBCL subtypes which indicates the need for further studies to make the 
results of the NGS more clinically relevant.

Recently, whole-exome sequencing (WES) has been used for genetic diagnoses of 
patients who remain otherwise undiagnosed. WES was performed in 177 Japanese 
patients with undiagnosed conditions who were referred to the Tokai regional 
branch of the Initiative on Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases (IRUD) (TOKAI-IRUD). 
This study included only patients who had not previously received genome-wide 
testing. Review meetings with specialists in various medical fields were held to 
evaluate the genetic diagnosis in each case, which was based on the guidelines 
of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. WES identified 
diagnostic single-nucleotide variants in 66 patients and copy number variants 
(CNVs) in 11 patients. Additionally, a patient was diagnosed with Angelman 
syndrome with a complex clinical phenotype upon detection of a paternally 
derived uniparental disomy (UPD) [upd(15)pat] wherein the patient carried a 
homozygous DUOX2 p.E520D variant in the UPD region. Functional analysis 
confirmed that this DUOX2 variant was a loss-of-function missense substitution 
and the primary cause of congenital hypothyroidism. A significantly higher 
proportion of genetic diagnoses was achieved compared to previous reports (44%, 
78/177 vs. 24-35%, respectively), probably due to detailed discussions and the 
higher rate of CNV detection.

22q11.2 deletion is one of the most well-known copy number variants (CNVs) 
associated with developing a psychiatric condition (e.g., schizophrenia), but 
there is a growing list of other CNVs which also confer substantial risk for 
developing psychiatric conditions. With increased use of chromosome microarray 
and exome sequencing, the frequency with which these CNVs are detected is 
increasing. While individuals with such CNVs often receive genetic counseling, 
research shows that associated psychiatric conditions are less often 
addressed-clinicians tend to focus on the nonpsychiatric manifestations of the 
CNV. This represents an important service gap for people with these CNVs and 
their families, as research shows that not only do these families want genetic 
counseling about psychiatric illness, it can also produce meaningful positive 
outcomes for people, including increases in empowerment, and self-efficacy. 
Therefore, there is a need to ensure that individuals with psychiatric 
condition-associated CNVs are being counseled about these manifestations of 
their condition in a way that can promote the best outcomes. In this paper we 
describe the process of providing genetic counseling in two clinical scenarios 
in which a psychiatric susceptibility CNV is identified: (1) in an individual 
who has not been diagnosed with a psychiatric condition and (2) in an individual 
with an established psychiatric condition.

Schizophrenia is a complex and often chronic psychiatric disorder with high 
heritability. Diagnosis of schizophrenia is still made clinically based on 
psychiatric symptoms; no diagnostic tests or biomarkers are available. 
Pathophysiology-based diagnostic scheme and treatments are also not available. 
Elucidation of the pathogenesis is needed for development of pathology-based 
diagnostics and treatments. In the past few decades, genetic research has made 
substantial advances in our understanding of the genetic architecture of 
schizophrenia. Rare copy number variations (CNVs) and rare single-nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) detected by whole-genome CNV analysis and whole-genome/-exome 
sequencing analysis have provided the great advances. Common single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) detected by large-scale genome-wide association studies 
have also provided important information. Large-scale genetic studies have been 
revealed that both rare and common genetic variants play crucial roles in this 
disorder. In this review, we focused on CNVs, SNVs, and SNPs, and discuss the 
latest research findings on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia based on these 
genetic variants. Rare variants with large effect sizes can provide mechanistic 
hypotheses. CRISPR-based genetics approaches and induced pluripotent stem cell 
technology can facilitate the functional analysis of these variants detected in 
patients with schizophrenia. Recent advances in long-read sequence technology 
are expected to detect variants that cannot be detected by short-read sequence 
technology. Various studies that bring together data from common variant and 
transcriptomic datasets provide biological insight. These new approaches will 
provide additional insight into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and 
facilitate the development of pathology-based therapeutics.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of three children 
with 22q13 deletion syndrome.
METHODS: Clinical data were collected and copy number variations in the patients 
and their parents were detected by using array-based comparative genomic 
hybridization (aCGH) and copy number variation sequencing (CNV-seq). The 
DECIPHER, ClinGen, OMIM, PubMed and Gene Review databases were retrieved for 
pathogenicity analysis.
RESULTS: The common phenotypes of the three children have included variable 
global developmental delay, among which speech delay was the most obvious. 
Patient 1 had abnormalities of corpus callosum shown by magnetic resonance 
imaging. Patient 2 had dental crowding, pale skin, thick palms, hypotonia, and 
other facial features. Patient 3 had the mildest symptoms including language 
dysfunction, which has caught up with the development and improved 
significantly. All of the three children had harbored de novo deletions of 
22q13.33q13.33 region, which spanned 0.84 Mb, 8.70 Mb and 0.90 Mb and involved 
37, 126, and 34 genes, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Above finding has enriched the clinical and genetic characteristics 
of 22q13 deletion syndrome and laid a foundation for genetic counseling and 
prenatal diagnosis.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We aim to develop an objective fully automated Artificial 
intelligence (AI) algorithm for MNV lesion size and leakage area segmentation on 
fluorescein angiography (FA) in patients with neovascular age-related macular 
degeneration (nAMD).
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two FA image datasets collected form large prospective 
multicentre trials consisting of 4710 images from 513 patients and 4558 images 
from 514 patients were used to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based 
algorithm to detect CNV lesion size and leakage area automatically. Manual 
segmentation of was performed by certified FA graders of the Vienna Reading 
Center. Precision, Recall and F1 score between AI predictions and manual 
annotations were computed. In addition, two masked retina experts conducted a 
clinical-applicability evaluation, comparing the quality of AI based and manual 
segmentations.
RESULTS: For CNV lesion size and leakage area segmentation, we obtained F1 
scores of 0.73 and 0.65, respectively. Expert review resulted in a slight 
preference for the automated segmentations in both datasets. The quality of 
automated segmentations was slightly more often judged as good compared to 
manual annotations.
CONCLUSIONS: CNV lesion size and leakage area can be segmented by our automated 
model at human-level performance, its output being well-accepted during clinical 
applicability testing. The results provide proof-of-concept that an automated 
deep learning approach can improve efficacy of objective biomarker analysis in 
FA images and will be well-suited for clinical application.

54.44% (515/946), including single chromosome abnormality (39.53%), two 
chromosome abnormality (2.22%), multi-chromosome abnormality (0.42%), triploidy 
or hypertriploidy (4.86%), copy number variants (CNVs) in 41 cases (4.33%), 
regions of homozygosity (ROH, 0.74%), mosaic (2.22%) and chimera (0.11%). (2) 
CNV analysis of 41 cases showed that 85.36% were pathogenic and likely 
pathogenic, 12.20% were classified as clinical significance unknown and 2.44% 
were interpreted as likely benign; (3) Among the cases of ROH, 2 cases shown 
whole-genome homozygosity and 1 case had completely homozygous at chromosome 21. 
The homozygous regions in 2 cases were located at the end of the short arm of 
chromosome 16, suggesting the mechanism of ROH in such cases could be the result 
of isodisomy.
CONCLUSION: Chromosome abnormality is an important genetic factor causing 
pregnancy loss. The application of CMA with SNP probes can indeed improve the 
detection rate of chromosome abnormalities and evaluate the risk of reproductive 
fertility in patients with pregnancy loss.

Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a 
rare lethal lung developmental disorder in neonates due to heterozygous 
loss-of-function of the mesenchymal transcription factor gene, FOXF1. 
Interestingly, unlike ACDMPV-causing point mutations in FOXF1 that can be 
inherited from the mother or father, causative copy-number variant (CNV) 
deletions arise de novo and almost exclusively on chromosome 16 inherited from 
the mother (n = 50 vs. n = 3). Here, we describe a fourth case of a de novo 
paternal CNV deletion encompassing FOXF1, its neighboring long non-coding RNA 
gene FENDRR, and their distant lung-specific enhancer, identified in a 
21-week-old fetus with tetralogy of Fallot, gastrointestinal and genitourinary 
abnormalities, a single umbilical artery, and patchy histopathological findings 
of ACDMPV in autopsy lung. We also review the ACDMPV-causative CNV deletions 
detected prenatally and propose that the majority of paternal deletions manifest 
with more severe additional non-lung abnormalities.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision 
loss in people over the age of 50 worldwide. Exudative or neovascular AMD is a 
more severe subset of AMD which is characterized by the presence of choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV). Recent advancements in multimodal ophthalmic imaging, 
including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A), have 
facilitated the detection and characterization of previously undetectable 
neovascular lesions and have enabled a more refined classification of CNV in 
exudative as well as nonexudative AMD patients. Subthreshold exudative CNV is a 
novel subtype of exudative AMD that typically presents asymptomatically with 
good visual acuity and is characterized by stable persistent or intermittent 
subretinal fluid (SRF). This review aims to provide an overview of the clinical 
as well as multimodal imaging characteristics of CNV in AMD, including this new 
clinical phenotype, and propose effective approaches for management.

In the present study, Porcine 60K SNP genotype data from 69 Landlly pigs were 
used to explore Copy Number Variations (CNVs) across the autosomes. A total of 
386 CNVs were identified using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in PennCNV software, 
which were subsequently aggregated to 115 CNV regions (CNVRs). Among the total 
detected CNVRs, 58 gain, 49 were loss type while remaining 8 events were both 
gain and loss types. Identified CNVRs covered 12.5 Mb (0.55%) of Sus scrofa 
reference 11.1 genome. Comparison of our results with previous investigations on 
pigs revealed that approximately 75% CNVRs were novel, which may be due to 
differences in genetic background, environment and implementation of artificial 
selection in Landlly pigs. Functional annotation and pathway analysis showed the 
significant enrichment of 267 well-annotated Sus scrofa genes in CNVRs. These 
genes were involved in different biological functions like sensory perception, 
meat quality traits, back fat thickness and immunity. Additionally, KIT and FUT1 
were two major genes detected on CNVR in our population. This investigation 
provided a comprehensive overview of CNV distribution in the Indian porcine 
genome for the first time, which may be useful for further investigating the 
association of important quantitative traits in Landlly pigs.Highlights115 CNVRs 
were identified in 69 Landlly pig population.Approximately 75% detected CNVRs 
were novel for Landlly population.Significant enrichment of 267 well-annotated 
Sus scrofa genes observed in these CNVRs.These genes were involved in different

OBJECTIVE: To carry out prenatal diagnosis for a fetus with normal 
ultrasonographic finding at 20 weeks' gestation but a copy number variant(CNV) 
of 13q indicated by non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT).
METHODS: Karyotyping analysis and chromosomal CNV assay were carried out on the 
amniotic fluid sample. Parental peripheral blood sample was collected for 
chromosomal analysis. Detailed fetal ultrasound scan was carried out to rule out 
structural abnormalities of the fetus.
RESULTS: The fetus was detected with a heterozygous 10.14 Mb deletion at 
13q21.1q21.32, which has originated from the phenotypically normal mother. No 
apparent karyotypic abnormality was detected in the fetus and its parents. No 
ultrasonic abnormality was found in the fetus.
CONCLUSION: Both the fetus and its mother have carried a heterozygous 10.14 Mb 
deletion at 13q21.1q21.32 and presented normal phenotypes.Combined with 
literature review, the segmental deletion was judged to be a benign variant.

BACKGROUND: Although copy number variations (CNVs) are infrequent, each anomaly 
is unique, and multiple CNVs can appear simultaneously. Growing evidence 
suggests that CNVs contribute to a wide range of diseases. When CNVs are 
detected, assessment of their clinical significance requires a thorough 
literature review. This process can be extremely time-consuming and may delay 
disease diagnosis. Therefore, we have developed CNV Extraction, Transformation, 
and Loading Artificial Intelligence (CNV-ETLAI), an innovative tool that allows 
experts to classify and interpret CNVs accurately and efficiently.
METHODS: We combined text, table, and image processing algorithms to develop an 
artificial intelligence platform that automatically extracts, transforms, and 
organizes CNV information into a database. To validate CNV-ETLAI, we compared 
its performance to ground truth datasets labeled by a human expert. In addition, 
we analyzed the CNV data, which was collected using CNV-ETLAI via a 
crowdsourcing approach.
RESULTS: In comparison to a human expert, CNV-ETLAI improved CNV detection 
accuracy by 4% and performed the analysis 60 times faster. This performance can 
improve even further with upscaling of the CNV-ETLAI database as usage 
increases. 5,800 CNVs from 2,313 journal articles were collected. Total CNV 
frequency for the whole chromosome was highest for chromosome X, whereas CNV 
frequency per 1 Mb of genomic length was highest for chromosome 22.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed, tested, and shared CNV-ETLAI for research and 
clinical purposes (https://lmic.mgh.harvard.edu/CNV-ETLAI). Use of CNV-ETLAI is 
expected to ease and accelerate diagnostic classification and interpretation of 
CNVs.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the small genomic fragment released by tumor 
cells into the circulating system, which carries the gene variation features, 
such as mutation, insertion, deletion, rearrangement, copy number variation 
(CNV) and methylation, rendering it an important biomarker. It can be used not 
only to diagnose certain types of solid tumors, but also to monitor the 
therapeutic response and explore the minimal residual disease (MRD) and 
resistant mutation of targeted therapy. Therefore, ctDNA detection may become 
the preferred non-invasive tumor screening method. For patients who cannot 
receive further gene detection due to insufficient or restricted sample 
collection with the defined pathological diagnosis, ctDNA detection can be 
carried out to determine the gene mutation type, with no need for repeated 
sampling. Gastric cancer (GC) is a malignancy with extremely high morbidity and 
mortality, and its genesis and development are the consequence of interactions 
of multiple factors, including environment, diet, heredity, helicobacter pylori 
infection, chronic inflammatory infiltration, and precancerous lesion. As the 
research on GC moves forward, the existing research mainly focuses on genetic 
and epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, 
non-coding RNA changes, gene mutation, gene heterozygosity loss and 
microsatellite instability. This paper aimed to summarize the contents of ctDNA 
detection, its application status in GC and clinical significance.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is often detectable prenatally. Advances 
in genetic testing have made it possible to obtain a molecular diagnosis in many 
fetuses with CDH. Here, we review the aneuploidies, copy number variants (CNVs), 
and single genes that have been clearly associated with CDH. We suggest that 
array-based CNV analysis, with or without a chromosome analysis, is the optimal 
test for identifying chromosomal abnormalities and CNVs in fetuses with CDH. To 
identify causative sequence variants, whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most 
comprehensive strategy currently available. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) with 
CNV analysis has the potential to become the most efficient and effective means 
of identifying an underlying diagnosis but is not yet routinely available for 
prenatal diagnosis. We describe how to overcome and address the diagnostic and 
clinical uncertainty that may remain after genetic testing, and review how a 
molecular diagnosis may impact recurrence risk estimations, mortality rates, and 
the availability and outcomes of fetal therapy. We conclude that after the 
prenatal detection of CDH, patients should be counseled about the possible 
genetic causes of the CDH, and the genetic testing modalities available to them, 
in accordance with generally accepted guidelines for pretest counseling in the 
prenatal setting.

Copy number variation (CNV) is a well-known type of genomic mutation that is 
associated with the development of human cancer diseases. Detection of CNVs from 
the human genome is a crucial step for the pipeline of starting from mutation 
analysis to cancer disease diagnosis and treatment. Next-generation sequencing 
(NGS) data provides an unprecedented opportunity for CNVs detection at the 
base-level resolution, and currently, many methods have been developed for CNVs 
detection using NGS data. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of CNVs 
structures and NGS data itself, accurate detection of CNVs still faces many 
challenges. In this paper, we present an alternative method, called KNNCNV 
(K-Nearest Neighbor based CNV detection), for the detection of CNVs using NGS 
data. Compared to current methods, KNNCNV has several distinctive features: 1) 
it assigns an outlier score to each genome segment based solely on its first k 
nearest-neighbor distances, which is not only easy to extend to other data types 
but also improves the power of discovering CNVs, especially the local CNVs that 
are likely to be masked by their surrounding regions; 2) it employs the 
variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VBGMM) to transform these scores 
into a series of binary labels without a user-defined threshold. To evaluate the 
performance of KNNCNV, we conduct both simulation and real sequencing data 
experiments and make comparisons with peer methods. The experimental results 
show that KNNCNV could derive better performance than others in terms of 
F1-score.

OBJECTIVE: We present a genetic analysis of an asymptomatic family with a 4q 
terminal deletion; we also review other similar published studies and discuss 
the genotype-phenotype correlation.
METHODS: A karyotype analysis was performed on the amniotic fluid cells of a 
woman at 24 weeks of pregnancy and peripheral blood lymphocytes from both 
parents and their older son with the conventional G-banding technique. 
Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) testing was carried out for both parents 
and the fetus to analyze copy number variation (CNV) in the whole genome.
RESULTS: The results showed no abnormalities in the karyotypes of the father and 
older son, and the karyotypes of the mother and fetus were 46,XX,del(4)(q35.1) 
and 46,XY,del(4)(q35.1), respectively. CMA results showed a partial deletion at 
the 4q terminus in both the fetus and mother. The deletion region of the fetus 
was arr[GRCh37] 4q35.1q35.2(186,431,008_190,957,460) × 1; the loss size of the 
CNV was approximately 4.5 Mb and involved 14 protein-coding genes, namely, 
CYP4V2, F11, FAM149A, FAT1, FRG1, FRG2, KLKB1, MTNR1A, PDLIM3, SORBS2, TLR3, 
TRIML1, TRIML2, and ZFP42. No variation on chromosome 4 was detected in the 
father's CMA results.
CONCLUSION: Deletion of the 4q subtelomeric region is a familial variation. The 
arr[GRCh37] 4q35.1q35.2(186,431,008_190,957,460) region single-copy deletion did 
not cause obvious congenital defects or mental retardation. The application of 
high-resolution genetic testing technology combined with the analysis of public 
genetic database information can more clearly elucidate the genotype-phenotype 
correlation of the disease and provide support for both prenatal and postnatal 
genetic counseling.

Serpiginous choroiditis (SC) is a rare, chronic, recurrent, progressive disease 
of unknown origin. The inflammatory process of SC can disrupt Bruch's membrane, 
allowing occasional choroidal vascular growth, leading to significant visual 
loss even in the healed stages of the disease. Optical coherence tomography 
angiography (OCTA) can help in the detection of choroidal neovascular membrane 
(CNV), leading to a definitive diagnosis and thereby guide the initiation of 
intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment. We 
report herein two cases of SC complicated with a CNV detected with OCTA and 
treated with a series of anti-VEGF injections.

Disorders of sex development (DSD) are a complex group of conditions with highly 
variable clinical phenotypes, most often caused by failure of gonadal 
development. DSD are estimated to occur in around 1.7% of all live births. 
Whilst the understanding of genes involved in gonad development has increased 
exponentially, approximately 50% of patients with a DSD remain without a genetic 
diagnosis, possibly implicating non-coding genomic regions instead. Here, we 
review how variants in the non-coding genome of DSD patients can be identified 
using techniques such as array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect 
copy number variants (CNVs), and more recently, whole genome sequencing (WGS). 
Once a CNV in a patient's non-coding genome is identified, putative regulatory 
elements such as enhancers need to be determined within these vast genomic 
regions. We will review the available online tools and databases that can be 
used to refine regions with potential enhancer activity based on chromosomal 
accessibility, histone modifications, transcription factor binding site 
analysis, chromatin conformation, and disease association. We will also review 
the current in vitro and in vivo techniques available to demonstrate the 
functionality of the identified enhancers. The review concludes with a clinical 
update on the enhancers linked to DSD.

Structural variation (SV) describes a broad class of genetic variation greater 
than 50 bp in size. SVs can cause a wide range of genetic diseases and are 
prevalent in rare developmental disorders (DDs). Individuals presenting with DDs 
are often referred for diagnostic testing with chromosomal microarrays (CMAs) to 
identify large copy-number variants (CNVs) and/or with single-gene, gene-panel, 
or exome sequencing (ES) to identify single-nucleotide variants, small 
insertions/deletions, and CNVs. However, individuals with pathogenic SVs 
undetectable by conventional analysis often remain undiagnosed. Consequently, we 
have developed the tool InDelible, which interrogates short-read sequencing data 
for split-read clusters characteristic of SV breakpoints. We applied InDelible 
to 13,438 probands with severe DDs recruited as part of the Deciphering 
Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and discovered 63 rare, damaging variants in 
genes previously associated with DDs missed by standard SNV, indel, or CNV 
discovery approaches. Clinical review of these 63 variants determined that about 
half (30/63) were plausibly pathogenic. InDelible was particularly effective at 
ascertaining variants between 21 and 500 bp in size and increased the total 
number of potentially pathogenic variants identified by DDD in this size range 
by 42.9%. Of particular interest were seven confirmed de novo variants in MECP2, 
which represent 35.0% of all de novo protein-truncating variants in MECP2 among 
DDD study participants. InDelible provides a framework for the discovery of 
pathogenic SVs that are most likely missed by standard analytical workflows and 
has the potential to improve the diagnostic yield of ES across a broad range of 
genetic diseases.

BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal 
aflibercept injections as the primary treatment for subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) by using optical coherence tomography (OCT). 
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was further used for some 
patients to detect the changes of CNV after treatment.
METHODS: In the present study, 21 treatment-naive eyes of 21 patients with 
subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic CNV received primary intravitreal aflibercept 
injections and were under follow-up for a minimum duration of 12 months. Among 
the 21 patients, 12 underwent OCTA to evaluate the changes in central foveal 
thickness, selected CNV area, and flow area.
RESULTS: The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) pertaining to all the 
patients significantly improved from the baseline value of 0.7 to 0.3 logMAR 
after treatment for 12 months (P = 0.001). However, the improvements in the 
median BCVA after treatment for three and 12 months were not statistically 
significant in the younger group (< 50 years), compared to the older group (≥ 
50 years). One aflibercept injection resolved the CNV in 47.6% (10/21) of the 
patients. The younger group displayed greater improvement in the median central 
foveal thickness, compared to the older group. OCTA revealed interlacing or 
disorganized pattern at the level of the outer retinal layer in 12 subjects with 
myopic CNV. After 3 months of treatment, both groups displayed a decrease in the 
size of the selected CNV area and flow area. The interlacing group displayed a 
trend towards better anatomical improvements.
CONCLUSION: Intravitreal aflibercept injection provides long-term improvement in 
visual acuity in patients with myopic CNV. Eyes with the interlacing pattern on 
OCTA displayed a greater decrease in size and flow after aflibercept injection.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Before data collection, written informed consent was

Current research suggests that alterations in neurodevelopmental processes, 
involving gene X environment interactions during key stages of brain development 
(prenatal period and adolescence), are a major risk for schizophrenia. First, 
epidemiological studies supporting a genetic contribution to schizophrenia are 
presented in this article, including family, twin, and adoption studies. Then, 
an extensive literature review on genetic disorders associated with 
schizophrenia is reviewed. These epidemiological findings and clinical 
observations led researchers to conduct studies on genetic associations in 
schizophrenia, and more specifically on genomics (CNV: copy-number variant, and 
SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism). The main structural (CNV) and sequence 
(SNP) variants found in individuals with schizophrenia are reported here. 
Evidence of genetic contributions to schizophrenia and current knowledge on 
genetic syndromes associated with this psychiatric disorder highlight the 
importance of a clinical genetic examination to detect minor physical anomalies 
in individuals with ultra-high risk of schizophrenia. Several dysmorphic 
features have been described in schizophrenia, especially in early onset 
schizophrenia, and can be viewed as neurodevelopmental markers of vulnerability. 
Early detection of individuals with neurodevelopmental abnormalities is a 
fundamental issue to develop prevention and diagnostic strategies, therapeutic 
intervention and follow-up, and to ascertain better the underlying mechanisms 
involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopmental disorder with absent language and variable 
seizures (NEDALVS, OMIM # 618707) is a newly described autosomal dominant 
condition caused by heterozygous de novo mutation in WASF1 gene. WASF1 is a key 
component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) required for actin 
polymerization. So far, only 3 distinct truncating variants clustering at the 
WCA domain, 3 missense variants localized to the meander region and a copy 
number variant (CNV) of WASF1 have been identified among 11 NEDALVS cases 
previously reported.
CASE REPORT: We report a pediatric patient carrying novel de novo heterozygous 
missense variant (NM_003931.2: c.481T > C, p.Trp161Arg) in WASF1 gene. During 
the first hospitalization at age of 5.5 months, the patient was initially 
diagnosed with infantile spasms, developmental delay (DD) and microcephaly due 
to nodding-like epileptic spasms in clusters and hypsarrhythmia on 
video-electroencephalography, lacking head control and body rollover, and 
abnormal head circumference 39 cm (<-2SD). The genetic diagnosis with a causal 
WASF1 variant detected by trio exome sequencing indicated the rare NEDALVS.
LITERATURE REVIEW: All the reported NEDALVS cases published in the PubMed 
English literature were reviewed to summarize the genetic and phenotypic 
spectrum of this novel disorder.
CONCLUSION: We describe the third patient with a recurrently mutated amino acid 
site at p.Trp161 in WASF1, currently the 12th patient with NEDALVS. This hotspot 
missense variant and the truncating variants in WASF1 lead to similar phenotypic 
patterns with core features of severe DD/ID, and seizures, hypotonia, and 
microcephaly frequently observed. Our finding expands the WASF1 mutation 
spectrum and confirms the de novo hotspot missense variant at p.Trp161, further 
supporting the association of the novel NEDALVS with WASF1 gene and the actin 
regulatory pathway.

A genetic etiology is identifiable in 20%-30% of patients with congenital heart 
defects (CHD). Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) can detect copy number 
variants (CNV) associated with CHD. In previous studies, the diagnostic yield of 
postnatal CMA testing ranged from 4% to 28% in CHD patients. However, incidental 
pathogenic CNV and variants of unknown significance are often discovered without 
any known association with CHD. The study objective was to describe the rate of 
pathogenic CNV associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) and compare 
clinical findings in CHD neonates with genetic results. A single-center 
retrospective review was performed on all consecutive newborns with CHD admitted 
to a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit from January 2013 to March 2019 
(n = 525). CHD phenotypes were classified as per the National Birth Defect 
Prevention Study. CMA detected pathogenic CNV in 21.3% (61/287) of neonates, and 
karyotype or fluorescence in situ hybridization detected aneuploidies in an 
additional 11% of the overall cohort (58/525). Atrioventricular septal defects 
and conotruncal defects showed the highest diagnostic yield by CMA (28.6% and 
27.2%, respectively). Among neonates with pathogenic CNV on CMA, 78.7% (48/61) 
were associated with NDI. Neonates with pathogenic CNV were smaller in length at 
birth compared to those with benign CNV or variants of unknown significance 
(p = 0.005) and were more likely to be discharged with an enteral feeding tube 
(p = 0.027). CMA can discover genetic variants associated with NDI and are 
common in neonates with CHD. Genetic testing in the neonatal period can heighten 
awareness of genetic risk for NDI.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been used to detect severe combined 
immunodeficiency (SCID) in patients, and some patients with DNA cross-link 
repair 1C (DCLRE1C) variants have been identified. Moreover, some compound 
variants, such as copy number variants (CNV) and single nucleotide variants 
(SNV), have been reported. The purpose of this study was to expand the genetic 
data related to patients with SCID carrying the compound DCLRE1C variant. 
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed for genetic analysis, and variants 
were verified by performing Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR. Moreover, we 
searched PubMed and summarized the data of the reported variants. Four SCID 
patients with DCLRE1C variants were identified in this study. WES revealed a 
homozygous deletion in the DCLRE1C gene from exons 1-5 in patient 1, exons 1-3 
deletion and a novel rare variant (c.92T>C, p.L31P) in patient 2, exons 1-3 
deletion and a novel rare variant (c.328C>G, p.L110V) in patient 3, and exons 
1-4 deletion and a novel frameshift variant (c.449dup, p.His151Alafs*20) in 
patient 4. Based on literature review, exons 1-3 was recognized as a hotspot 
region for deletion variation. Moreover, we found that compound variations (CNV 
+ SNV) accounted for approximately 7% variations in all variants. When patients 
are screened for T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs), NGS can be used to 
expand genetic testing. Deletion of the DCLRE1C gene should not be ignored when 
a variant has been found in patients with SCID.

Congenital heart defects (CHD) affect 50% of Down's syndrome (DS) cases. This 
review focusses on the pathogenic molecular mechanism leading to the formation 
of DS-associated CHD along with the advancement of the emerging diagnostic 
techniques available for such patients in past few decades. We have shed light 
on the causative genes of DS-associated CHD that are located either on 
chromosome 21 or outside chromosome 21. Along with locus-specific mutation, 
numerous SNP and CNV, miRNA, use of maternal folic acid during pregnancy and 
signalling pathways are also reported to contribute to the formation of CHD in 
patients with DS. With the help of both these our understanding of pathogenic 
mechanism causing CHD in DS cases along with the availability of emerging 
technologies has facilitated a novel discovery that has ultimately provided a 
better treatment and management for such cases. Accurate diagnosis and treatment 
are now available with the introduction of CNV detection and NGS based 
approaches such as WES, WGS, target sequencing and sequencing of foetal 
cell-free DNA by the medical geneticist and cardiologist have now allowed 
further identification of familial recurrence risk and relatives who are at risk 
through genetic counselling, thereby providing reproductive options and 
improving proper care of DS-associated CHD. Further, gene-editing studies 
explore novel pathogenic mechanisms and signalling pathways in DS-associated 
CHD.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer. 
Its incidence is rising faster than any other cancer in the United States and it 
remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While 
advances in massive parallel sequencing and integration of 'omics information 
have transformed the field of oncology, tissue access is often limited in HCC 
and a single biopsy is poorly representative of the known genetic heterogeneity 
of tumours. Liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising strategy for analysing 
circulating tumour components including circulating tumour DNA. Cell-free DNA 
and tumour DNA are derived from necrotic, apoptotic and living eukaryotic cells. 
The profiling of genetic and epigenetic alterations in circulating cell-free DNA 
has potential clinical applications including early disease detection, 
prediction of treatment response and prognostication in real time. Novel 
biomarker candidates for disease detection and monitoring are under study. Of 
these, methylation analyses of circulating tumour DNA have shown promising 
performance for early HCC detection in at-risk patients. Assessments of assay 
performance in longitudinal validation cohorts are ongoing. Implementation of 
liquid biopsy for HCC will likely improve upon the current surveillance 
strategy. This review summarises the most recent developments on the role and 
utility of circulating cell-free DNA in the detection and management of HCC.

Background: Genetic disorders are a substantial cause of infant morbidity and 
mortality and are frequently suspected in neonatal intensive care units. 
Non-specific clinical presentation or limitations to physical examination can 
result in a plethora of genetic testing techniques, without clear strategies on 
test ordering. Here, we review our 2-years experiences of rapid genetic testing 
of NICU patients in order to provide such recommendations. Methods: We 
retrospectively included all patients admitted to the NICU who received clinical 
genetic consultation and genetic testing in our University hospital. We 
documented reasons for referral for genetic consultation, presenting phenotypes, 
differential diagnoses, genetic testing requested and their outcomes, as well as 
the consequences of each (rapid) genetic diagnostic approach. We calculated 
diagnostic yield and turnaround times (TATs). Results: Of 171 included infants 
that received genetic consultation 140 underwent genetic testing. As a result of 
testing as first tier, 13/14 patients received a genetic diagnosis from QF-PCR; 
14/115 from SNP-array; 12/89 from NGS testing, of whom 4/46 were diagnosed with 
a small gene panel and 8/43 with a large OMIM-morbid based gene panel. 
Subsequent secondary or tertiary analysis and/or additional testing resulted in 
five more diagnoses. TATs ranged from 1 day (QF-PCR) to a median of 14 for NGS 
and SNP-array testing, with increasing TAT in particular when many consecutive 
tests were performed. Incidental findings were detected in 5/140 tested patients 
(3.6%). Conclusion: We recommend implementing a broad NGS gene panel in 
combination with CNV calling as the first tier of genetic testing for NICU 
patients given the often unspecific phenotypes of ill infants and the high yield 
of this large panel.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical utility of prenatal chromosomal microarray 
analysis (CMA) in fetuses with abnormal renal sonographic findings, and to 
evaluate the association of pathogenic or likely pathogenic copy number variants 
(P/LP CNVs) with different types of renal abnormality.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of fetuses at 14-36 weeks screened 
routinely for renal and other structural abnormalities at the Maternal and Child 
Health Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. We retrieved and analyzed 
data from fetuses with abnormal renal sonographic findings, examined between 
January 2013 and November 2019, which underwent CMA analysis using tissue 
obtained from chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis or cordocentesis. 
We evaluated the CMA findings according to type of renal ultrasound anomaly and 
according to whether renal anomalies were isolated or non-isolated.
RESULTS: Ten types of renal anomaly were reported on prenatal ultrasound 
screening, at a mean ± SD gestational age of 24.9 ± 4.8 weeks. The anomalies 
were diagnosed relatively late in this series, as 64% of cases with an isolated 
renal anomaly underwent cordocentesis rather than CVS. Fetal pyelectasis was the 
most common renal ultrasound finding, affecting around one-third (34.32%, 
301/877) of fetuses with a renal anomaly, but only 3.65% (n = 11) of these 
harbored a P/LP CNV (comprising: isolated cases, 2.37% (4/169); non-isolated 
cases, 5.30% (7/132)). Hyperechogenic kidney was found in 5.47% (n = 48) of 
fetuses with a renal anomaly, of which 39.58% (n = 19) had a P/LP CNV finding 
(comprising: isolated cases, 44.44% (16/36); non-isolated cases, 25.00% (3/12)), 
the highest diagnostic yield among the different types of renal anomaly. Renal 
agenesis, which accounted for 9.92% (n = 87) of all abnormal renal cases, had a 
CMA diagnostic yield of 12.64% (n = 11) (comprising: isolated cases, 11.54% 
(9/78); non-isolated cases, 22.22% (2/9); unilateral cases, 11.39% (9/79); 
bilateral cases, 25.00% (2/8)), while multicystic dysplastic kidney (n = 110), 
renal cyst (n = 34), renal dysplasia (n = 27), crossed fused renal ectopia 
(n = 31), hydronephrosis (n = 98), renal duplication (n = 42) and ectopic kidney 
(n = 99) had overall diagnostic rates of 11.82%, 11.76%, 7.41%, 6.45%, 6.12%, 
4.76% and 3.03%, respectively. Compared with the combined group of CMA-negative 
fetuses with any other type of renal anomaly, the rate of infant being alive and 
well at birth was significantly higher in CMA-negative fetuses with isolated 
fetal pyelectasis or ectopic kidney, whereas the rate was significantly lower in 
fetuses with isolated renal agenesis, multicystic dysplastic kidney or severe 
hydronephrosis. The most common pathogenic CNV was 17q12 deletion, which 
accounted for 30.14% (22/73) of all positive CMA findings, with a rate of 2.51% 
(22/877) among fetuses with an abnormal renal finding. Fetuses with 17q12 
deletion exhibited a wide range of renal phenotypes. Other P/LP CNVs in the 
recurrent region that were associated with prenatal renal ultrasound 
abnormalities included 22q11.2, Xp21.1, Xp22.3, 2q13, 16p11.2 and 1q21, which, 
collectively, accounted for 2.17% (19/877) of the fetuses with prenatal renal 
anomalies.
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review of CMA findings in a large cohort of 
fetuses with different types of renal ultrasound abnormality, the P/LP CNV 
detection rate varied significantly (3.03-39.58%) among the different types of 
kidney anomaly. Our data may help in the decision regarding whether to perform 
prenatal genetic testing in fetuses with renal ultrasound findings. 
Specifically, prenatal CMA testing should be performed in cases of 
hyperechogenic kidney, regardless of whether or not the anomaly is isolated, 
while it should be performed postnatally rather than prenatally in cases of 
fetal pyelectasis. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and

University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.

Pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) contribute to the etiology of 
neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders (NDs). Increased CNV burden has 
been found to be critically involved in NDs compared with controls in clinical 
studies. The 1q21.1 CNVs, rare and large chromosomal microduplications and 
microdeletions, are detected in many patients with NDs. Phenotypes of 
duplication and deletion appear at the two ends of the spectrum. Microdeletions 
are predominant in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) and microcephaly, 
whereas microduplications are predominant in individuals with autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD) and macrocephaly. However, its complexity hinders the discovery 
of molecular pathways and phenotypic networks. In this review, we summarize the 
recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) that have identified candidate 
genes positively correlated with 1q21.1 CNVs, which are likely to contribute to 
abnormal phenotypes in carriers. We discuss the clinical data implicated in the 
1q21.1 genetic structure that is strongly associated with neurodevelopmental 
dysfunctions like cognitive impairment and reduced synaptic plasticity. We 
further present variations reported in the phenotypic severity, genomic 
penetrance and inheritance.

Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) has become the first-tier testing for 
chromosomal abnormalities and copy number variations (CNV). This review 
described the clinical validation of CMA, the development and updating of 
technical standards and guidelines and their diagnostic impacts. The main 
focuses were on the development and updating of expert consensus, practice 
resources, and a series of technical standards and guidelines through systematic 
review of case series with CMA application in the literature. Expert consensus 
and practice resource supported the use of CMA as the first-tier testing for 
detecting chromosomal abnormalities and CNV in developmental and intellectual 
disabilities, multiple congenital anomalies and autism. The standards and 
guidelines have been applied to pre- and postnatal testing for constitutional 
CNV and tumor testing for acquired CNV. CMA has significantly improved the 
diagnostic yields but still needs to overcome its technical limitations and face 
challenges of new technologies. Guiding and governing CMA through expert 
consensus, practice resource, standards and guidelines in the United States has 
provided effective and safe diagnostic services to patients and their families, 
reliable diagnosis on related genetic diseases for clinical database and basic 
research, and references for clinical translation of new technologies.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness. The main 
risk factor is advancing age, with the severity of vision loss ranging from mild 
to severe. There is a 25% risk of early AMD and 8% risk of late AMD in patients 
over the age of 75, with the number of cases expected to increase because of the 
aging population. Diagnosis of the disease requires a dilated fundus 
examination. Physicians should be aware of the symptoms, risk factors, and 
treatment options for AMD to refer appropriately for ophthalmologic evaluation. 
Early detection can be helpful to prevent disease progression.

Cutaneous intermediate melanocytic neoplasms with ambiguous histopathological 
features are diagnostically challenging. Ancillary cytogenetic techniques to 
detect genome-wide copy number variations (CNVs) might provide a valuable tool 
to allow accurate classification as benign (nevus) or malignant (melanoma). 
However, the CNV cut-off value to distinguish intermediate lesions from melanoma 
is not well defined. We performed a systematic review and individual patient 
data meta-analysis to evaluate the use of CNVs to classify intermediate 
melanocytic lesions. A total of 31 studies and 431 individual lesions were 
included. The CNV number in intermediate lesions (median 1, interquartile range 
[IQR] 0-2) was significantly higher (p<0.001) compared to that in benign lesions 
(median 0, IQR 0-1) and lower (p<0.001) compared to that in malignant lesions 
(median 6, IQR 4-11). The CNV number displayed excellent ability to 
differentiate between intermediate and malignant lesions (0.90, 95% CI 
0.86-0.94, p<0.001). Two CNV cut-off points demonstrated a sensitivity and 
specificity higher than 80%. A cut-off of ≥3 CNVs corresponded to 85% 
sensitivity and 84% specificity, and a cut-off of ≥4 CNVs corresponded to 81% 
sensitivity and 91% specificity, respectively. This individual patient data 
meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of CNVs in cutaneous 
intermediate melanocytic lesions, based on the largest pooled cohort of 
ambiguous melanocytic neoplasms to date. Our meta-analysis suggests that a 
cut-off of ≥3 CNVs might represent the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and 
specificity in clinical practice to differentiate intermediate lesions from 
melanoma.

Molecular profiling of tumor samples has acquired importance in cancer research, 
but currently also plays an important role in the clinical management of cancer 
patients. Rapid identification of genomic aberrations improves diagnosis, 
prognosis and effective therapy selection. This can be attributed mainly to the 
development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, especially targeted DNA 
panels. Such panels enable a relatively inexpensive and rapid analysis of 
various aberrations with clinical impact specific to particular diagnoses. In 
this review, we discuss the experimental approaches and bioinformatic strategies 
available for the development of an NGS panel for a reliable analysis of 
selected biomarkers. Compliance with defined analytical steps is crucial to 
ensure accurate and reproducible results. In addition, a careful validation 
procedure has to be performed before the application of NGS targeted assays in 
routine clinical practice. With more focus on bioinformatics, we emphasize the 
need for thorough pipeline validation and management in relation to the 
particular experimental setting as an integral part of the NGS method 
establishment. A robust and reproducible bioinformatic analysis running on 
powerful machines is essential for proper detection of genomic variants in 
clinical settings since distinguishing between experimental noise and real 
biological variants is fundamental. This review summarizes state-of-the-art 
bioinformatic solutions for careful detection of the SNV/Indels and CNVs for 
targeted sequencing resulting in translation of sequencing data into clinically 
relevant information. Finally, we share our experience with the development of a 
custom targeted NGS panel for an integrated analysis of biomarkers in 
lymphoproliferative disorders.

Genetic architecture predisposes regions of the human genome to copy-number 
variants, which confer substantial disease risk, most prominently towards 
neurodevelopmental disorders. These variants typically contain multiple genes 
and are often associated with extensive pleiotropy and variable phenotypic 
expressivity. Despite the expansion of the fidelity of CNV detection, and the 
study of such lesions at the population level, understanding causal mechanisms 
for CNV phenotypes will require biological testing of constituent genes and 
their interactions. In this regard, model systems amenable to high-throughput 
phenotypic analysis of dosage-sensitive genes (and combinations thereof) are 
beginning to offer improved granularity of CNV-driven pathology. Here, we review 
the utility of Drosophila and zebrafish models for pathogenic CNV regions, 
highlight the advances made in discovery of single gene drivers and genetic 
interactions that determine specific CNV phenotypes, and argue for their 
validity in dissecting conserved developmental mechanisms associated with CNVs.

In 1959, 63 years after the death of John Langdon Down, Jérôme Lejeune 
discovered trisomy 21 as the genetic reason for Down syndrome. Screening for 
Down syndrome has been applied since the 1960s by using maternal age as the risk 
parameter. Since then, several advances have been made. First trimester 
screening, combining maternal age, maternal serum parameters and ultrasound 
findings, emerged in the 1990s with a detection rate (DR) of around 90-95% and a 
false positive rate (FPR) of around 5%, also looking for trisomy 13 and 18. With 
the development of high-resolution ultrasound, around 50% of fetal anomalies are 
now detected in the first trimester. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for 
trisomy 21, 13 and 18 is a highly efficient screening method and has been 
applied as a first-line or a contingent screening approach all over the world 
since 2012, in some countries without a systematic screening program. 
Concomitant with the rise in technology, the possibility of screening for other 
genetic conditions by analysis of cfDNA, such as sex chromosome anomalies 
(SCAs), rare autosomal anomalies (RATs) and microdeletions and duplications, is 
offered by different providers to an often not preselected population of 
pregnant women. Most of the research in the field is done by commercial 
providers, and some of the tests are on the market without validated data on 
test performance. This raises difficulties in the counseling process and makes 
it nearly impossible to obtain informed consent. In parallel with the advent of 
new screening technologies, an expansion of diagnostic methods has begun to be 
applied after invasive procedures. The karyotype has been the gold standard for 
decades. Chromosomal microarrays (CMAs) able to detect deletions and 
duplications on a submicroscopic level have replaced the conventional 
karyotyping in many countries. Sequencing methods such as whole exome sequencing 
(WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) tremendously amplify the diagnostic 
yield in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies.

Current status of home monitoring technology for age-related macular 
degeneration.

Busquets MA(1), Sabbagh O(1)(2).

(1)Retina Associates of Kentucky.
(2)Department of Ophthalmology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, 
USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Evidence suggests that patients present with exudative 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in a delayed fashion. Increased lesion 
size associated with this delay directly impacts visual acuity. Upon treatment 
initiation, patients are monitored largely with optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) technology to determine the need for treatment. Home-monitoring systems 
using preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP) and OCT may optimize management.
RECENT FINDINGS: Comparison of Age-related Macular Degeneration Treatment Trials 
study and American Academy of Ophthalmology's Intelligent Research in Sight 
registry data suggest smaller lesion size and better visual acuity upon 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) capture are associated with better final 
visual acuity with therapy. The HOME study and recent PHP-based ForeseeHome data 
indicate that this modality leads to earlier detection of CNV. Results of a 
real-world data analysis demonstrate 82% retention of ≥20/40 vision with median 
visual acuity of 20/40 at time of CNV detection using PHP home-monitoring. Home 
OCT data suggests excellent patient useability, with >90% of patients obtaining 
analyzable images. The Notal OCT Analyzer demonstrates superiority over human 
interpreters regarding the ability to detect intraretinal and subretinal fluid 
(82% vs. 47% sensitivity).
SUMMARY: PHP may improve treatment outcomes for exudative AMD by allowing for 
earlier detection of lesions. Home OCT platforms could allow for more convenient 
monitoring of patients undergoing treatment for exudative AMD and better enable 
true PRN models.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Advancements in technologies have revolutionized prenatal 
diagnosis. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) became a proven method and was 
implemented to detect gains and losses of DNA and absence of heterozygosity 
across the genome. Next-generation sequencing technologies have brought 
opportunities and challenges to genetic testing. Exome sequencing detects 
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the exome and its prenatal application 
is an emerging field. We reviewed the literature to define the role of CMA and 
exome sequencing in prenatal diagnosis.
RECENT FINDING: The application of exome sequencing in genetic diagnosis shows 
increased diagnostic yield and could be potentially implemented for prenatal 
diagnosis of fetuses with one or more ultrasound structural abnormalities or 
suspected monogenetic conditions. Although CMA is a gold standard for copy 
number variant (CNV) detection, large clinical cohort studies emphasized 
integrated CNV and SNV analyses for precise molecular diagnosis. Recent studies 
also suggest low-pass genome sequencing-based CNV detection can identify 
genome-wide imbalances at higher resolutions.
SUMMARY: Data suggest exome sequencing for SNVs and CMA for CNV detection are 
the most effective approach for prenatal genetic diagnosis. Emerging evidences 
show genome sequencing has the potential to replace CMA and even exome 
sequencing to become a comprehensive genetic test in the clinical diagnostic 
laboratory.

Partial trisomy 16q and partial monosomy 7p of a fetus derivated from paternal 
balanced translocation: A case report.

University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China.

INTRODUCTION: Subchromosomal deletions and duplications could currently be 
detected by noninvasive preliminary screening (NIPS). However, NIPS is a 
screening test that requires further diagnosis. Here we report a fetus with an 
autosomal abnormality revealed by NIPS and conventional karyotype combined with 
copy number variations sequencing (CNV-seq) confirmed the fetus with an 
unbalanced translocation.
PATIENT CONCERN: This was the fourth pregnancy of a 30-year-old woman who 
underwent 2 spontaneous abortions and gave birth to a child with a normal 
phenotype. The woman and her husband were healthy and nonconsanguineous. NIPS 
indicated a repeat of about 19-Mb fragment at the region of 16q22.1-q22.4 at 
17-week gestation.
DIAGNOSES: The combination of traditional karyotype and CNV-seq could better 
locate the abnormal chromosomal region and further identify the source of fetal 
chromosomal abnormalities. Simultaneously, we evaluated the fetal morphology by 
ultrasound examination. The karyotype of the fetus was 
46,XX,der(7)t(7;16)(p22;q23) and CNV-seq results showed an approximately 
20.96-Mb duplication in 16q22.1-q24.3 (69200001-90160000) and an approximately 
3.86-Mb deletion in 7p22.3-p22.2 (40001-3900000). Prenatal ultrasound revealed 
the fetal micrognathia. The paternal karyotype was 46,XY, t (7;16) (p22;q23), 
while the maternal was normal. The fetus inherited an abnormal chromosome 7 from 
its father.
INTERVENTIONS: No treatment for the fetus.
OUTCOMES: Pregnancy was terminated.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the occurrence of de novo partial trisomy 16q 
(16q22.1-qter) and partial monosomy 7p (7p22.2-pter) has not previously been 
reported up to now. Here, we present the perinatal findings of such a case and a 
review of the literatures. CNV-seq combined with karyotype is a useful tool for 
chromosomal abnormalities indicated by NIPS.

Introduction: Genetic variants in over 100 genes can cause non-syndromic hearing 
loss (NSHL). Comprehensive diagnostic testing of these genes requires detecting 
pathogenic sequence and copy number alterations with economical, scalable and 
sensitive assays. Here we discuss best practices and effective testing 
algorithms for hearing-loss-related genes with special emphasis on detection of 
copy number variants.Areas covered: We review studies that used next-generation 
sequencing (NGS), chromosomal microarrays, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and 
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the diagnosis of 
NSHL. We specifically focus on unique and recurrent copy number changes that 
affect the GJB2 and STRC genes, two of the most common causes of NSHL.Expert 
opinion: NGS panels and exome sequencing can detect most pathogenic sequence and 
copy number variants that cause NSHL; however, GJB2 and STRC currently require 
additional assays to capture all pathogenic copy number variants. Adoption of 
genome sequencing may simplify diagnostic workflows, but further investigational 
studies will be required to evaluate its clinical efficacy.

PURPOSE: To review cases of couples presented to our PGT-unit with copy number 
variants (CNVs) classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in order 
to better understand their needs.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary medical-center, 
2014-2019. We reviewed files of all couples applying for genetic counseling with 
CNVs classified as VUS. The main outcomes measured: number of VUS findings and 
their description, PGT-M procedures planned and performed, IVF cycles, clinical 
pregnancy, and live birth rates (LBR). VUS were classified according to the 
American-College of Medical-Genetics and Genomics classification at time of 
first consultation, and updated-December 2018.
RESULTS: Twenty-four couples presented with a total of 30 VUS. Twelve couples 
(50%) had isolated VUS and 12 (50%) had VUS diagnosed in addition to a 
pathogenic mutation. Initially, nine findings (30%) were defined as VUS; eight 
(27%) as likely benign (b-VUS); and 13 (43%) as likely pathogenic (p-VUS). PGT-M 
was recommended for 17/30 CNVs (56.6%), 12 (70%) of which, isolated VUS. No 
couple had other indications for IVF. To date, nine couples performed PGT-M for 
isolated VUS; LBR per-couple-55.5%. Five couples performed PGT-M for both 
pathogenic findings and VUS, LBR-80%. After reviewing VUS classifications, 30% 
remained unchanged, 20% were more severely defined, and 50% less severely 
defined.
CONCLUSION: The genomic era enables detection of VUS whose definition is subject 
to change as additional information becomes available. The uncertainty of 
variants' clinical significance and changes in VUS definition over time 
complicates genetic counseling. Revised guidelines for VUS interpretation and 
reevaluation of patient counseling before each pregnancy must be practiced when 
counseling them regarding the justification of PGT-M for their diagnosed VUS.

Copy number variations (CNVs) are an important class of variations contributing 
to the pathogenesis of many disease phenotypes. Detecting CNVs from genomic data 
remains difficult, and the most currently applied methods suffer from an 
unacceptably high false positive rate. A common practice is to have human 
experts manually review original CNV calls for filtering false positives before 
further downstream analysis or experimental validation. Here, we propose 
DeepCNV, a deep learning-based tool, intended to replace human experts when 
validating CNV calls, focusing on the calls made by one of the most accurate CNV 
callers, PennCNV. The sophistication of the deep neural network algorithm is 
enriched with over 10 000 expert-scored samples that are split into training and 
testing sets. Variant confidence, especially for CNVs, is a main roadblock 
impeding the progress of linking CNVs with the disease. We show that DeepCNV 
adds to the confidence of the CNV calls with an optimal area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve of 0.909, exceeding other machine learning 
methods. The superiority of DeepCNV was also benchmarked and confirmed using an 
experimental wet-lab validation dataset. We conclude that the improvement 
obtained by DeepCNV results in significantly fewer false positive results and 
failures to replicate the CNV association results.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of optical coherence 
tomography angiography (OCTA) in detecting the choroidal neovascularization 
(CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching 
Pubmed, Science Direct, Embase, and Web of Science. The pooled sensitivity and 
specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), area under the summary receiver 
operator characteristic curve (sROC), and the total accurate classification rate 
were used to evaluate OCTA's diagnostic value of CNV in AMD patients.
RESULTS: Seven studies involving 517 eyes were included in the analysis. The 
mean age of subjects in each study ranged from 58.5 years to 81.7 years. 
Fluorescein angiography was applied as the gold standard in 5 studies. There 
were 350 eyes diagnosed with CNV, OCTA detected 301 eyes correctly, while among 
the 167 eyes without CNV, OCTA identified 150 correctly. The total accurate 
classification rate was 87.23%. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 
0.5, indicating that there was no significant threshold effect in the current 
study (S = 8, p = 0.103). The pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity were 
0.89 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.94) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.00), respectively. The area 
under sROC was up to 0.911.
CONCLUSION: The specificity of OCTA for the detection of CNV in AMD patients is 
extremely high; however, the sensitivity still needs to be improved. In general, 
the meta-analysis revealed that OCTA had a high diagnostic value for the 
detection of CNV in AMD patients.

PURPOSE: In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), HER2 (ERBB2) gene amplification 
is implicated in anti-EGFR therapy resistance. We sought to determine the 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and efficacy of neratinib, a pan-ERBB kinase 
inhibitor, combined with cetuximab, in patients with progressive disease (PD) on 
anti-EGFR treatment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with quadruple-wild-type, refractory 
mCRC enrolled in this 3+3 phase Ib study. Standard dosage cetuximab was 
administered with neratinib at 120 mg, 160 mg, 200 mg, and 240 mg/day orally in 
28-day cycles. Samples were collected for molecular and pharmacokinetic studies.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). 240 
mg was determined to be the RP2D wherein a single DLT occurred (1/7 patients). 
Treatment-related DLTs were not seen at lower doses. Best response was stable 
disease (SD) in 7 of 16 (44%) patients. HER2 amplification (chromogenic in situ 
IHC) was detected in 2 of 21 (9.5%) treatment-naïve tumors and 4 of 16 (25%) 
biopsies upon trial enrollment (post-anti-EGFR treatment and progression). 
Compared with matched enrollment biopsies, 6 of 8 (75%) blood samples showed 
concordance for HER2 CNV in circulating cell-free DNA. Five SD patients had HER2 
amplification in either treatment-naïve or enrollment biopsies. Examination of 
gene-expression, total protein, and protein phosphorylation levels showed 
relative upregulation of ≥2 members of the HER-family receptors or ligands upon 
enrollment versus matched treatment-naïve samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The RP2D of neratinib in this combination was 240 mg/day, which was 
well tolerated with low incidence of G3 AEs. There were no objective responses; 
SD was seen at all neratinib doses. HER2 amplification, detectable in both 
tissue and blood, was more frequent post-anti-EGFR therapy.

Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (neovascular ARMD) represents only 
10% of ARMD cases but is responsible, if untreated, for quick and severe central 
vision loss due to major macular changes. The presence of choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) in one eye is associated with an approximately 10% risk 
of CNV development in the fellow eye each year. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy 
has quickly evolved as the standard treatment in neovascular ARMD in the last 
decade due to significant anatomical and functional improvements, especially in 
the early stages. In many reports an improvement in the untreated fellow eye was 
mentioned and systemic exposure was soon confirmed for all anti-VEGF agents 
after unilateral intravitreal injection. In particular, bevacizumab intravitreal 
injection is followed by a consistent reduction of serum VEGF levels and the 
drug was shown to have the longest serum half-life raising important debates 
about its safety. Once bevacizumab was detected in the fellow eye of an animal 
model after unilateral injection, the possible influence on fellow eye 
conversion rate into neovascular ARMD was questioned. Although comparative 
studies have not found statistically significant differences between drugs 
regarding the incidence of symptomatic CNV in the fellow eye during treatment, 
we observed, on a retrospective 36-month evaluation, a reduced incidence of 
symptomatic CNV in the fellow eye that might be explained by the consistent 
systemic exposure of bevacizumab.

The detection of copy number variations (CNVs) on whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
represents a cost-effective technique for the study of genetic variants. This 
approach, however, has encountered an obstacle with high false-positive rates 
due to biases from exome sequencing capture kits and GC contents. Although 
plenty of CNV detection tools have been developed, they do not perform well with 
all types of CNVs. In addition, most tools lack features of genetic annotation, 
CNV visualization, and flexible installation, requiring users to put much effort 
into CNV interpretation. Here, we present "inCNV," a web-based application that 
can accept multiple CNV-tool results, then integrate and prioritize them with 
user-friendly interfaces. This application helps users analyze the importance of 
called CNVs by generating CNV annotations from Ensembl, Database of Genomic 
Variants (DGV), ClinVar, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). 
Moreover, users can select and export CNVs of interest including their flanking 
sequences for primer design and experimental verification. We demonstrated how 
inCNV could help users filter and narrow down the called CNVs to a potentially 
novel CNV, a common CNV within a group of samples of the same disease, or a de 
novo CNV of a sample within the same family. Besides, we have provided in CNV as 
a docker image for ease of installation (https://github.com/saowwapark/inCNV).

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have significantly influenced 
many facets of the healthcare sector. Advancement in technology has paved the 
way for analysis of big datasets in a cost- and time-effective manner. Clinical 
oncology and research are reaping the benefits of AI. The burden of cancer is a 
global phenomenon. Efforts to reduce mortality rates requires early diagnosis 
for effective therapeutic interventions. However, metastatic and recurrent 
cancers evolve and acquire drug resistance. It is imperative to detect novel 
biomarkers that induce drug resistance and identify therapeutic targets to 
enhance treatment regimes. The introduction of the next generation sequencing 
(NGS) platforms address these demands, has revolutionised the future of 
precision oncology. NGS offers several clinical applications that are important 
for risk predictor, early detection of disease, diagnosis by sequencing and 
medical imaging, accurate prognosis, biomarker identification and identification 
of therapeutic targets for novel drug discovery. NGS generates large datasets 
that demand specialised bioinformatics resources to analyse the data that is 
relevant and clinically significant. Through these applications of AI, cancer 
diagnostics and prognostic prediction are enhanced with NGS and medical imaging 
that delivers high resolution images. Regardless of the improvements in 
technology, AI has some challenges and limitations, and the clinical application 
of NGS remains to be validated. By continuing to enhance the progression of 
innovation and technology, the future of AI and precision oncology show great 
promise.

Copy number variants (CNVs), defined as genome sequences of ≥50 bp that differ 
in copy number from that in a reference genome, are a common form of structural 
variation. Germline CNVs account for some of the missing heritability that 
single nucleotide polymorphisms could not account for. Recent technological 
advances have had a huge impact on CNV research. Microarray technology enables 
relatively low-cost, high-throughput, genome-wide measurements, and short-read 
sequencing technology enables the detection of short CNVs that cannot be 
detected by microarrays. As a result, large-scale genetic studies have been able 
to identify a variety of common and rare germline CNVs and their associations 
with diseases. Rare germline CNVs have been reported to be associated with 
neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we focused on germline CNVs and 
briefly described their functional characteristics, formation mechanisms, 
detection methods, related databases, and the latest findings. Finally, we 
introduced recent large-scale genetic studies to assess associations of CNVs 
with diseases, especially psychiatric disorders, and discussed the use of 
CNV-based animal models to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms 
underlying these disorders. The development and implementation of improved 
detection methods, such as long-read single-molecule sequencing, are expected to 
provide additional insight into the molecular basis of psychiatric disorders and 
other complex diseases, thus facilitating basic and clinical research on CNVs.

A majority of BRCA1/2 (BRCA) pathogenic variants (PVs) are single nucleotide 
substitutions or small insertions/deletions. Copy number variations (CNVs), also 
known as large genomic rearrangements (LGRs), have been identified in BRCA 
genes. LGRs detection is a mandatory analysis in hereditary breast and ovarian 
cancer families, if no predisposing PVs are found by sequencing. Next generation 
sequencing (NGS) may be used to detect structural variation, since quantitative 
analysis of sequencing reads, when coupled with appropriate bioinformatics 
tools, is capable of estimating and predicting germline LGRs (gLGRs). However, 
applying this approach to tumor tissue is challenging, and the pipelines for 
determination of CNV are yet to be optimized. The aim of this study was to 
validate the Next Generation Tumor Sequencing (NGTS) technology to detect 
various gLGRs of BRCA1 locus in surgical tumor tissue samples. In this study, 
seven different BRCA1 gLGRs, previously found in high-grade serous ovarian 
cancers (HGSOC) patients, were detected in tumor samples collected from the 
patients at a time of HGSOC surgery. This study demonstrated that NGS can 
accurately detect BRCA1 gLGRs in primary tumors, suggesting that gLGR evaluation 
in BRCA1 locus should be performed in cases when the screening for BRCA 
alterations starts from tumor instead of blood. NGS sequencing of tumor samples 
may become the preferred method to detect both somatic and germline gLGRs in 
BRCA-encoding loci.

OBJECTIVE: Multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell neoplasm, afflicts elder 
individuals accounting for 10% of hematologic malignancies. The MM plasma cells 
largely reside within the bone marrow niche and are accessible through an 
invasive bone marrow biopsy, which is challenging during serial monitoring of 
patients. In this setting, cell free DNA (cfDNA) may have a role to ascertain 
the molecular aberrations at diagnosis and in assessment of residual disease 
during therapy. The aim of this review was to explore the utility and current 
status of cfDNA in MM.
METHOD: PubMed was searched with terms including cell-free DNA, 
circulating-tumor DNA, Multiple Myeloma, diagnosis, genomic profiling, Minimal 
Residual Disease individually or in combination to shortlist the relevant 
studies.
RESULT: cfDNA serves as a non-invasive source of tumor-specific molecular 
biomarker, ctDNA that has immense potential in facilitating management of cancer 
patients. The mutation detection platforms for ctDNA include hybrid capture and 
ultra-deep sequencing. Hybrid capture allows full length gene sequencing for 
mutation and CNV detection. The disease progression can be monitored by 
profiling prognostic somatic copy number alterations by ultra-low pass whole 
genome sequencing of ctDNA cost-effectively. Evolution of both the laboratory 
protocols and bioinformatics tools may further improve the sensitivity of ctDNA 
detection for better disease management. Only a limited number of studies were 
available in MM exploring the potential utility of cfDNA.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we discuss the nuances and challenges associated 
with molecular evaluation of cfDNA and its potential role in diagnosis and 
monitoring of treatment response in MM.

Recently, researches on copy number variation （CNV） have extended to every 
field, such as etiological exploration and precise treatment of complex 
diseases, as well as genetic breeding and evolution. The unique genetic 
characteristics of CNV have made people gradually believe that it could be used 
as a biological genetic marker to solve related problems. With the development 
of detection technology, application of CNV in forensic medicine will increase 
gradually. In this paper, the concept and development of CNV, as well as its 
application in forensic medicine are summarized, to provide new ideas for the 
practical application of CNV in the future.

DNA copy number variants (CNVs) account for approximately 300 Mb of sequence 
variation in the normal human genome. Significant numbers of pathogenic CNVs 
contribute toward human genetic disorders. Recent studies suggest a higher 
diagnostic and clinical significance of low-pass genome sequencing (LP-GS) 
compared with chromosomal microarrays (CMAs). The performance metrics of the 5X 
LP-GS was compared with CMA to validate a low-cost and high-throughput method. 
LP-GS test performed on 409 samples (including 78 validation and 331 clinical) 
was evaluated using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 
guidelines. The CNV accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity were 
calculated to be 100% for all previously characterized CNVs by CMA. Samples 
(n = 6) run at both approximately 30X GS and approximately 5X GS (LP-GS) average 
depth detected a concordance of 89.43% to 91.8% and 77.42% to 89.86% for overall 
single-nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions, respectively. In the 331 
clinical samples, 17.2% each were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic and 
uncertain clinical significance. In addition, several cases with pathogenic CNVs 
were detected that were missed by CMA. This study demonstrates that LP-GS (5X 
GS) was able to reliably detect absence of heterozygosity, 
microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, and intragenic CNVs with higher 
coverage and resolution over the genome. Because of lower cost, higher 
resolution, and greater sensitivity of this test, our study in combination with 
other reports could be used in an evidence-based review by professional 
societies to recommend replacing CMAs.

Disorders of sex development (DSD) are a well-known cause of sterility and 
reduced fertility in dogs. Here, we report on 6 new cases of DSD in French 
bulldogs diagnosed by us within the last year. The animals were phenotypical 
females who underwent detailed diagnosis due to the presence of an enlarged 
clitoris or a penis-like structure with atypically located urethral orifice 
(hypospadias). A female karyotype (78,XX) and lack of Y-linked genes (SRY and 
ZFY) were observed in 5 cases, which were classified as XX (SRY-negative) DSD. 
Gonads histology could be performed in 4 XX DSD cases: testicular tissue was 
observed in 3 cases and ovotesticular tissue in 1 case. In the last case, 
leukocyte chimerism (XX/XY) was detected alongside an ovotestis with epididymis 
and fallopian tubes. This case was classified as freemartinism. Our study and a 
literature review showed that heritable XX (SRY-negative) DSD is quite common in 
French bulldogs, but spontaneously developed freemartinism can be also 
diagnosed. In conclusion, we postulate that the description of the sexual 
phenotype of DSD females (enlarged clitoris and presence of testicular tissue) 
does not distinguish between hereditary XX DSD and nonhereditary freemartinism. 
Cytogenetic and molecular analyses are thus necessary to correctly diagnose such 
cases. This is especially important for the French bulldog breed, as a rapid 
increase in its population could spread hereditary DSD.

PURPOSE: To investigate the association between the presence of type 1 choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) and the localized progression of atrophy in age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD).
DESIGN: Analysis of patients' data collected in the context of 2 
noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at the Department of 
Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59 patients (40 female, 
19 male) with a mean (±standard deviation) age at baseline of 76.60±6.65 years 
and median (interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55) were 
included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on multimodal imaging and 
ocular history: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-naïve 
quiescent CNV (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and RPE 
atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81).
METHODS: Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis of 
serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance images. If CNV was 
detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its location and dimension were spatially 
mapped to RPE atrophy. The localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic 
relation to the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic 
regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and 
observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in 
areas overlying type 1 CNV.
RESULTS: The prediction model achieved a high overlap between predicted and 
observed RPE atrophy progression with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds 
for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of 0.21 (95% CI, 
0.19-0.24) in the presence of treatment-naïve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a 
factor of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1 CNV.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is markedly reduced RPE atrophy 
progression in areas co-localizing with quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This 
observation is compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on 
the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may have relevant 
clinical implications for the management of CNV and lead to new therapeutic 
strategies to prevent atrophy progression.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) enables the analysis of all protein coding 
sequences in the human genome. This technology enables the investigation of 
cancer-related genetic aberrations that are predominantly located in the exonic 
regions. WES delivers high-throughput results at a reasonable price. Here, we 
review analysis tools enabling utilization of WES data in clinical and research 
settings. Technically, WES initially allows the detection of single nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs), and data obtained through 
these methods can be combined and further utilized. Variant calling algorithms 
for SNVs range from standalone tools to machine learning-based combined 
pipelines. Tools for CNV detection compare the number of reads aligned to a 
dedicated segment. Both SNVs and CNVs help to identify mutations resulting in 
pharmacologically druggable alterations. The identification of homologous 
recombination deficiency enables the use of PARP inhibitors. Determining 
microsatellite instability and tumor mutation burden helps to select patients 
eligible for immunotherapy. To pave the way for clinical applications, we have 
to recognize some limitations of WES, including its restricted ability to detect 
CNVs, low coverage compared to targeted sequencing, and the missing consensus 
regarding references and minimal application requirements. Recently, Galaxy 
became the leading platform in non-command line-based WES data processing. The 
maturation of next-generation sequencing is reinforced by Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved methods for cancer screening, detection, and 
follow-up. WES is on the verge of becoming an affordable and sufficiently 
evolved technology for everyday clinical use.

Disorders of sex development (DSD) are a group of rare conditions characterized 
by discrepancy between chromosomal sex, gonads and external genitalia. 
Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract are often associated 
with DSD, mostly in multiple malformation syndromes. We describe the case of an 
11-year-old Caucasian boy, with right kidney hypoplasia and hypospadias. 
Genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) analysis revealed a unique duplication 
of about 550 kb on chromosome Xq27, and a 46,XX karyotype, consistent with a sex 
reversal phenotype. This region includes multiple genes, and, among these, SOX3 
emerged as the main phenotypic driver. This is the fifth case reporting a 
genomic imbalance involving the SOX3 gene in a 46,XX SRY-negative male, and the 
first with associated renal malformations. Our data provide plausible links 
between SOX3 gene dosage and kidney malformations. It is noteworthy that the 
current and reported SOX3 gene duplications are below the detection threshold of 
standard karyotypes and were found only by analyzing CNVs using DNA microarrays. 
Therefore, all 46,XX SRY-negative males should be screened for SOX3 gene 
duplications with DNA microarrays.

We analyzed and compared the sensitivity of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) 
detection according to CNV type in patients with active neovascular age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) using swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) 
angiography (OCTA). A retrospective chart review was performed in patients with 
neovascular AMD. OCTA images were classified into three groups: Group A 
(well-circumscribed vascular complex); Group B (moderately circumscribed 
vascular complex); and Group C (poorly circumscribed vascular complex), 
according to CNV appearance. Demographic characteristics, OCT parameters, 
neovascularization subtypes, and OCTA image quality were analyzed to determine 
the effect on visualization of the neovascular complex. A total of 130 patients 
with CNV secondary to active neovascular AMD were analyzed. Among them, 52 eyes 
from 47 patients were included in the study. Eighteen eyes (34.6%) were 
classified into Group A, 24 (46.2%) into Group B, and 10 (19.2%) into Group C. 
Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in demographic 
characteristics or OCT parameters between the three groups. Overall sensitivity 
of active CNV detection was 80.7% (42/52 eyes). In 73.5% (25/34) of eyes with 
type 1 CNV (sub-retinal pigment epithelial type), 100.0% (9/9) of eyes with type 
2 CNV (sub-retinal type), and 88.9% (8/9) of eyes with type 3 CNV (retinal 
angiomatous proliferation type), the vascular complex was well visualized on 
OCTA. OCTA provides adequate noninvasive imaging of CNV in patients with 
neovascular AMD, which may assist in CNV diagnosis and activity monitoring. In 
particular, type 2 CNV was well detected in OCTA in comparison with type 1 and 
type 3 CNV.

BACKGROUND: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), an innovative image 
technique, renders visualization of ocular neovascularization through 
non-invasive means, which has been applied in recent years. Therefore, the 
present study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of OCTA in detecting 
the choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
METHODS: In brief, PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were 
systematically searched from January 2014 to June 2019. Afterwards, a 
meta-analysis was performed to determine the pooled diagnostic accuracy in a 
random-effects model using STATA 15.1 and Meta-Disc 1.4 software. Quality 
Assessment of diagnostic Accuracy Version 2 was used to evaluate the risk of 
bias of each study by Revman 5.3 software. In addition, a meta-regression model 
was further conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: According to pre-set inclusion and exclusion criteria, 16 eligible 
studies were enrolled in this study. A total of 447 CNV eyes and 414 non-CNV 
eyes were included to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of OCTA. As a result, 
the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative 
likelihood ratio (PLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and the area under the 
summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC-AUC) were 0.87 (95% CI 
0.81-0.92), 0.97 (95% CI 0.92-0.99), 32.7 (95% CI 10.1-105.5), 0.13 (95% CI 
0.08-0.20), 252 (95% CI 63-1011) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.97), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we demonstrated that OCTA was of high diagnostic value 
for detecting intraocular CNV.

Antenatal diagnosis of cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome: prenatal characteristics 
and contribution of fetal facial dysmorphic signs in utero. This paper is a case 
study and review of literature. "RASopathies" is the term coined for a group of 
genetic diseases that share modulation inside the MAPKinase pathway. Mutations 
inside the coding sequence of any of these genes may be responsible for the 
upregulation of the RAS pathway, leading on the clinical level to Type 1 
Neurofibromatosis (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome (CS), Multiple 
Lentigines, Loose Anagen Hair syndrome, Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous syndrome (CFCS), 
and, more recently, Legius syndrome. While the postnatal presentation of this 
group is well-known, prenatal findings are less well recognized. The presence of 
a RASopathy during the prenatal period can be suspected on account of 
non-specific abnormalities: polyhydramnios, cystic hygroma or high nuchal 
translucency, macrosomia with proportionate short long bones, macrocephaly, 
renal, lymphatic, or cardiac defects. The current case report underlines the 
characteristic dysmorphic facial features on 3D-ultrasound (hypertelorism, 
down-slanting palpebral fissures, a long and marked philtrum, and low-set 
posteriorly rotated ears) that allow for a "RASopathy" to be postulated. After 
detecting a copy number variation (CNV) absence on a CGH array, we performed a 
RASopathy gene panel analysis, which identified a so-far unreported heterozygous 
de novo mutation in the BRAF gene (namely NM_004333.4 : c.1396 G > C ; 
p.Gly466Arg). Genetic counseling has, therefore, focused on the diagnosis of a 
RASopathy and predictable phenotype of CFCS, a distinct entity characterized by 
an increased risk of intellectual disability and early-onset feeding problems. 
We suggest that a more detailed prenatal facial evaluation should be performed 
in fetuses presenting high nuchal thickness, heart defects, or unusual findings, 
along with the absence of a CNV on a CGH array. Due to the dysmorphic facial 
features, targeted RASopathy genes are presumed to likely to be responsible for 
NS, CFCS, and CS.

Del(20q) is the most frequently detected large structural genetic mosaicism 
alteration in the healthy aging population, occurring in approximately 0.1% of 
older persons. Age-related clonal hematopoiesis of copy number variations (CNVs) 
is linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancies, but the clinical 
impact of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) harboring such CNVs, such as del(20q), 
is not clearly understood. Here, we report an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
patient with known del(20q) who acquired donor-derived del(20q) after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The HSCs with del(20q) engrafted 
and expanded over time, but the patient did not clinically progress to myeloid 
neoplasm. Although donor-derived del(20q) from a healthy donor has been reported 
previously, our case is the first to review the clonal dynamics of a del(20q) 
clone and its post-transplantation impact. Since recurrent hematology 
neoplasm-associated CNVs, including del(20q), may not be rare among aged HSCT 
donors, identifying the origin of such a CNV is necessary for clinical decisions 
when clonal abnormality appears after HSCT, even in recipients who previously 
had the same abnormality.

BACKGROUND: Gene variants are dependable and sensitive biomarkers for 
target-specific therapies in breast cancer (BC). However, detection of mutations 
within tissues has many limitations. Plasma circulating free DNA (cfDNA) has 
been reported in many studies as an alternative tool for detection of mutations. 
But the diagnostic accuracy of cfDNA for most mutations in BC needs to be 
reviewed. This study was designed to perform comparative assessment of the 
diagnostic performance of cfDNA and DNA extracted from tissues for detection of 
single nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number variants (CNV).
METHODS: True-positive (TP), false-positive (FP), false-negative (FN), and 
true-negative (TN) values were extracted from each selected study. Pooled 
sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood 
ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. Subgroup analysis 
and single study omitted analysis were performed to quantify and explain the 
study heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Twenty eligible studies that involved 1055 cases were included in this 
meta-analysis. SNV studies in early breast cancer (EBC) subgroup are not 
suitable for meta-analysis owing to high heterogeneity. However, in advanced 
breast cancer (ABC) subgroup, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of 
detection of SNVs were 0.78 (0.71-0.84) and 0.92 (0.87-0.95), respectively. The 
summary receiver operative curve (SROC) exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) 
of 0.91(0.88-0.93). The pooled results of studies involving subgroups of PIK3CA, 
TP53, and ESR1 indicate that the diagnostic value of different genes is 
different, such as AUC for PIK3CA and TP53 were reported to be 0.96 (0.94-0.98) 
and 0.94 (0.91-0.95), respectively, and ESR1 had the lowest diagnostic value of 
0.80 (0.76-0.83). Owing to the low sensitivity and AUC in the cases of CNV, 
there is no value for cfDNA-based detection of CNV based on insufficient amount 
of CNV data.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that the detection of gene mutations in 
cfDNA have adequate diagnostic accuracy and can be used as an alternative to the 
tumor tissue for detection of SNV but not for CNV in BC yet.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are intermediate-scale structural variants 
containing copy number changes involving DNA fragments of between 1 kb and 5 Mb. 
Although known to account for a significant proportion of the genetic burden in 
human disease, the role of CNVs (especially small CNVs) is often underestimated, 
as they are undetectable by traditional Sanger sequencing. Since the development 
of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, several research groups have 
compared depth of coverage (DoC) patterns between samples, an approach that may 
facilitate effective CNV detection. Most CNV detection tools based on DoC 
comparisons are designed to work with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. However, few methods developed to date are 
designed for custom/commercial targeted NGS (tg-NGS) panels, the assays most 
commonly used for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, the development and evaluation 
of these tools is hindered by (i) the scarcity of thoroughly annotated data 
containing CNVs and (ii) a dearth of simulation tools for WES and tg-NGS that 
mimic the errors and biases encountered in these data. Here, we review DoC-based 
CNV detection methods described in the current literature, assess their 
performance with simulated tg-NGS data, and discuss their strengths and 
weaknesses when integrated into the daily laboratory workflow. Our findings 
suggest that the best methods for CNV detection in tg-NGS panels are DECoN, 
ExomeDepth, and ExomeCNV. Regardless of the method used, there is a need to make 
these programs more user-friendly to enable their use by diagnostic laboratory 
staff who lack bioinformatics training.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are regions of the genome that vary in integer copy 
number. CNVs, which comprise both amplifications and deletions of DNA sequence, 
have been identified across all domains of life, from bacteria and archaea to 
plants and animals. CNVs are an important source of genetic diversity, and can 
drive rapid adaptive evolution and progression of heritable and somatic human 
diseases, such as cancer. However, despite their evolutionary importance and 
clinical relevance, CNVs remain understudied compared to single-nucleotide 
variants (SNVs). This is a consequence of the inherent difficulties in detecting 
CNVs at low-to-intermediate frequencies in heterogeneous populations of cells. 
Here, we discuss molecular methods used to detect CNVs, the limitations 
associated with using these techniques, and the application of new and emerging 
technologies that present solutions to these challenges. The goal of this short 
review and perspective is to highlight aspects of CNV biology that are 
understudied and define avenues for further research that address specific gaps 
in our knowledge of these complex alleles. We describe our recently developed 
method for CNV detection in which a fluorescent gene functions as a single-cell 
CNV reporter and present key findings from our evolution experiments in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a CNV reporter, we found that CNVs are generated 
at a high rate and undergo selection with predictable dynamics across 
independently evolving replicate populations. Many CNVs appear to be generated 
through DNA replication-based processes that are mediated by the presence of 
short, interrupted, inverted-repeat sequences. Our results have important 
implications for the role of CNVs in evolutionary processes and the molecular 
mechanisms that underlie CNV formation. We discuss the possible extension of our 
method to other applications, including tracking the dynamics of CNVs in models 
of human tumors.

OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of copy number variations (CNV) on developmental 
aspects of children suspected of having delayed development.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done for 65 children who underwent 
array-comparative genomic hybridization after visiting physical medicine & 
rehabilitation department of outpatient clinic with delayed development as chief 
complaints. Children were evaluated with Denver Developmental Screening Test II 
(DDST-II), Sequenced Language Scale for Infants (SELSI), or Preschool 
Receptive-Expressive Language Scale (PRES). A Mann-Whitney U test was conducted 
to determine statistical differences of developmental quotient (DQ), receptive 
language quotient (RLQ), and expressive language quotient (ELQ) between children 
with CNV (CNV(+) group, n=16) and children without CNV (CNV(-) group, n=37).
RESULTS: Of these subjects, the average age was 35.1 months (mean age, 35.1±24.2 
months). Sixteen (30.2%) patients had copy number variations. In the CNV(+) 
group, 14 children underwent DDST-II. In the CNV(-) group, 29 children underwent 
DDSTII. Among variables, gross motor scale was significantly (p=0.038) lower in 
the CNV(+) group compared with the CNV(-) group. In the CNV(+) group, 5 children 
underwent either SELSI or PRES. In the CNV(-) group, 27 children underwent above 
language assessment examination. Both RLQ and ELQ were similar between the two 
groups.
CONCLUSION: The gross motor domain in DQ was significantly lower in children 
with CNV compared to that in children without CNV. This result suggests that 
additional genetic factors contribute to this variability. Active detection of 
genomic imbalance could play a vital role when prominent gross motor delay is 
presented in children with delayed development.

BACKGROUND: The clinical features of Down syndrome vary among individuals, with 
those most common being congenital heart disease, intellectual disability, 
developmental abnormity and dysmorphic features. Complex combination of Down 
syndrome phenotype could be produced by partially copy number variations (CNVs) 
on chromosome 21 as well. By comparing individual with partial CNVs of 
chromosome 21 with other patients of known CNVs and clinical phenotypes, we hope 
to provide a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation of 
chromosome 21.
METHODS: A total of 2768 pediatric patients sample collected at the Genetics 
Laboratory at Oklahoma University Health Science Center were screened using CGH 
Microarray for CNVs on chromosome 21.
RESULTS: We report comprehensive clinical and molecular descriptions of six 
patients with microduplication and seven patients with microdeletion on the long 
arm of chromosome 21. Patients with microduplication have varied clinical 
features including developmental delay, microcephaly, facial dysmorphic 
features, pulmonary stenosis, autism, preauricular skin tag, eye pterygium, 
speech delay and pain insensitivity. We found that patients with microdeletion 
presented with developmental delay, microcephaly, intrauterine fetal demise, 
epilepsia partialis continua, congenital coronary anomaly and seizures.
CONCLUSION: Three patients from our study combine with four patients in public 
database suggests an association between 21q21.1 microduplication of CXADR gene 
and patients with developmental delay. One patient with 21q22.13 microdeletion 
of DYRK1A shows association with microcephaly and scoliosis. Our findings helped 
pinpoint critical genes in the genotype-phenotype association with a high 
resolution of 0.1 Mb and expanded the clinical features observed in patients 
with CNVs on the long arm of chromosome 21.

BACKGROUND: To describe the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVB) 
and/or transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) in the treatment of small pigmented 
choroidal lesions with subfoveal fluid (SFF), and to investigate prognostic 
value of the therapeutic response in future tumor growth.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 19 patients, who were diagnosed with 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-free small pigmented choroidal lesions and 
treated with IVB and/or TTT, was performed.
RESULTS: Complete resolution of SFF was achieved in two eyes (2/14; 14.3%) after 
IVB, and in three eyes (3/4; 75%) after TTT. Best corrected visual acuity was 
improved in two eyes (2/9; 22%) after IVB, and in three eyes (3/4; 75%) after 
TTT. Among five patients who underwent TTT after IVB, four patients (4/5; 80%) 
demonstrated additional advantage. All IVBs could not reduce tumor sizes. 
Rather, tumor growth was detected in seven out of 14 eyes (7/14; 50%) that 
underwent IVB. None of the patients who underwent TTT showed tumor growth. The 
lack of treatment response to IVB was suggestive of malignancy, as most small 
pigmented lesions that had no response to IVB showed tumor growth (86%, 
p = 0.010).
CONCLUSION: IVB was not effective in reducing tumor size and subfoveal fluid in 
small pigmented choroidal lesions. Therapeutic response to IVB can be used as an 
indicator between melanoma and nevus in small pigmented choroidal lesion.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence 
tomography angiography (OCTA) in detecting vascular characteristics of 
chorio-retinal disease.
METHODS: Evidence acquisition: We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline 
by the citation of references and complemented these electronic searches by 
checking the list of references of included and review articles. Screening, 
selection, assessment, and extraction was performed in parallel by two authors.
RESULTS: Evidence synthesis: Systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis. 
The ten studies that contributed to the meta-analysis enrolled 440 eyes and 
allowed constructing ten two-by-two tables. The tables reported on detection of 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in eyes suffering from either age-related 
macular degeneration (4), central serous chorioretinopathy (2), myopia (2), 
foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy (1), or a mixed cohort suffering from 
multiple retinal diseases (1). Of the ten studies, six used a cohort and four a 
case-control design. We found a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 (95% confidence 
intervals (CIs): 0.82-0.95) and a pooled specificity of 0.97 (95% CI: 
0.89-0.99). Corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios were 32.3 (95% 
CI: 7.4-141.6) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.06-0.20), respectively. No pooling was 
possible for retinal vascular parameters of diabetic retinopathy, polypoidal 
choroidal vasculopathy, or detection of CNV activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of highly biased and heterogeneous studies assessing 
the diagnostic performance of OCTA highlight the need for further analyses of 
methodologically sound and sufficiently sized clinical evaluations.

BACKGROUND: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has increased in popularity and 
decreased in cost over the past decade, rendering this approach as a viable and 
sensitive method for variant detection. In addition to its utility for single 
nucleotide variant detection, WGS data has the potential to detect Copy Number 
Variants (CNV) to fine resolution. Many CNV detection software packages have 
been developed exploiting four main types of data: read pair, split read, read 
depth, and assembly based methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
efficiency of each of these main approaches in detecting germline deletions.
METHODS: WGS data and high confidence deletion calls for the individual NA12878 
from the Genome in a Bottle consortium were the benchmark dataset. The 
performance of BreakDancer, CNVnator, Delly, FermiKit, and Pindel was assessed 
by comparing the accuracy and sensitivity of each software package in detecting 
deletions exceeding 1 kb.
RESULTS: There was considerable variability in the outputs of the different WGS 
CNV detection programs. The best performance was seen from BreakDancer and 
Delly, with 92.6% and 96.7% sensitivity, respectively and 34.5% and 68.5% false 
discovery rate (FDR), respectively. In comparison, Pindel, CNVnator, and 
FermiKit were less effective with sensitivities of 69.1%, 66.0%, and 15.8%, 
respectively and FDR of 91.3%, 69.0%, and 31.7%, respectively. Concordance 
across software packages was poor, with only 27 of the total 612 benchmark 
deletions identified by all five methodologies.
CONCLUSIONS: The WGS based CNV detection tools evaluated show disparate 
performance in identifying deletions ≥1 kb, particularly those utilising 
different input data characteristics. Software that exploits read pair based 
data had the highest sensitivity, namely BreakDancer and Delly. BreakDancer also 
had the second lowest false discovery rate. Therefore, in this analysis read 
pair methods (BreakDancer in particular) were the best performing approaches for 
the identification of deletions ≥1 kb, balancing accuracy and sensitivity. There 
is potential for improvement in the detection algorithms, particularly for 
reducing FDR. This analysis has validated the utility of WGS based CNV detection 
software to reliably identify deletions, and these findings will be of use when 
choosing appropriate software for deletion detection, in both research and 
diagnostic medicine.

Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is recommended as a first tier investigation for 
patients with developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), autistic 
spectrum disorder (ASD), and multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). It is widely 
used in the prenatal and postnatal settings for detection of chromosomal 
aberrations. This is a retrospective review of all array comparative genomic 
hybridization (aCGH/ array CGH) findings ascertained in two major prenatal and 
postnatal genetic diagnostic centers in Hong Kong from June 2012 to December 
2017. Medical records were reviewed for cases with pathogenic and variants of 
uncertain clinical significance (VUS). Classification of copy number variants 
(CNVs) was based on current knowledge and experience by August 2018. The aims of 
this review are to study the diagnostic yield of array CGH application in 
prenatal and postnatal settings in Hong Kong and to describe the spectrum of 
abnormalities found. Prenatal indications included abnormal ultrasound findings, 
positive Down syndrome screening, abnormal noninvasive prenatal test results, 
advanced maternal age and family history of chromosomal or genetic 
abnormalities. Postnatal indications included unexplained DD, ID, ASD, and MCA. 
A total of 1,261 prenatal subjects and 3,096 postnatal patients were reviewed. 
The prenatal diagnostic yield of pathogenic CNV and VUS (excluding those 
detectable by karyotype) was 3.5%. The postnatal diagnostic yield of pathogenic 
CNV was 15.2%. The detection rates for well-defined microdeletion and 
microduplication syndromes were 4.6% in prenatal and 6.1% (1 in 16 index 
patients) in postnatal cases, respectively. Chromosomes 15, 16, and 22 accounted 
for over 21 and 25% of pathogenic CNVs detected in prenatal and postnatal 
cohorts, respectively. This review provides the first large scale overview of 
genomic imbalance of mostly Chinese patients in prenatal and postnatal settings.

PURPOSE: To compare optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) review 
strategies for optimizing choroidal neovascularization (CNV) detection.
METHODS: Eyes with CNV in the differential diagnosis were imaged with the Avanti 
RTVue XR HD (Optovue, Fremont, CA). Three modalities of review for CNV presence 
were used in each case: a single report generated using automated segmentation 
within Avanti software; a continuous slab descent video OCTA export; and a 
manual segmentation approach using cross-sectional OCT with decorrelation signal 
overlay. Scans were reviewed by two masked expert reviewers; a third reviewer 
was used for discrepancies.
RESULTS: The study included 421 eyes, and 350 eyes had reports deemed sufficient 
quality for interpretation. Choroidal neovascularization was in the differential 
diagnosis in 107 of 350 patients. Overall CNV was identified in 55% (59/107) 
eyes. In those eyes with CNV, the automated segmentation identified CNV in 56% 
(33/59) of cases, continuous slab descent method identified CNV in 53% (31/59) 
of cases, and the manual segmentation group identified CNV in 92% (54/59) of 
cases.
CONCLUSION: Review strategies for detection of CNV on OCTA were highest using 
the manual segmentation method as compared to both the automated report and 
continuous slab descent methods. Although the manual segmentation method had a 
higher rate of detection, the practical aspects of the time required for 
segmentation make this method challenging in routine clinical practice.

Identifying genes and variants contributing to rare disease phenotypes and 
Mendelian conditions informs biology and medicine, yet potential phenotypic 
consequences for variation of >75% of the ~20,000 annotated genes in the human 
genome are lacking. Technical advances to assess rare variation genome-wide, 
particularly exome sequencing (ES), enabled establishment in the United States 
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported Centers for Mendelian 
Genomics (CMGs) and have facilitated collaborative studies resulting in novel 
"disease gene" discoveries. Pedigree-based genomic studies and rare variant 
analyses in families with suspected Mendelian conditions have led to the 
elucidation of hundreds of novel disease genes and highlighted the impact of de 
novo mutational events, somatic variation underlying nononcologic traits, 
incompletely penetrant alleles, phenotypes with high locus heterogeneity, and 
multilocus pathogenic variation. Herein, we highlight CMG collaborative 
discoveries that have contributed to understanding both rare and common diseases 
and discuss opportunities for future discovery in single-locus Mendelian 
disorder genomics. Phenotypic annotation of all human genes; development of 
bioinformatic tools and analytic methods; exploration of non-Mendelian modes of 
inheritance including reduced penetrance, multilocus variation, and oligogenic 
inheritance; construction of allelic series at a locus; enhanced data sharing 
worldwide; and integration with clinical genomics are explored. Realizing the 
full contribution of rare disease research to functional annotation of the human 
genome, and further illuminating human biology and health, will lay the 
foundation for the Precision Medicine Initiative.

Current (high throughput omics-based) data support the model that human 
(malignant) germ cell tumors are not initiated by somatic mutations, but, 
instead through a defined locked epigenetic status, representative of their cell 
of origin. This elegantly explains the role of both genetic susceptibility as 
well as environmental factors in the pathogenesis, referred to as 
'genvironment'. Moreover, it could also explain various epidemiological 
findings, including the rising incidence of this type of cancer in Western 
societies. In addition, it allows for identification of clinically relevant and 
informative biomarkers both for diagnosis and follow-up of individual patients. 
The current status of these findings will be discussed, including the use of 
high throughput DNA methylation profiling for determination of differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs) as well as chromosomal copy number variation (CNV). 
Finally, the potential value of methylation-specific tumor DNA fragments (i.e., 
XIST promotor) as well as embryonic microRNAs as molecular biomarkers for cancer 
detection in liquid biopsies will be presented.

OBJECTIVE: The coexistence of maternal malignancy and pregnancy has received 
increasing attention in Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) studies. Malignancy 
in pregnant women potentially affects the copy number variation (CNV) profile in 
NIPT results. Only one case of hematologic cancer has been reported in a 
Hong-Kong pregnant women, and solid tumors have never been reported in pregnant 
Chinese women.
CASE REPORT: The patients with dysgerminoma and cervical cancer showed aberrant 
chromosomal aneuploidies in NIPT and concordant patterns of genome disruption in 
tumor tissues. The genomic aberrations in the gastric cancer patient had similar 
copy number variation pattern of gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION: The findings in this study and the literature review further 
validate the effect of maternal malignancy on the copy number variation profile 
in NIPT data and strengthen the possibility of detecting malignant tumors with 
NIPT in the future.

BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive pleiotropic 
disorder of the primary cilia that leads to severe visual loss in the teenage 
years. Approximately 80% of BBS cases are explained by mutations in one of the 
21 identified genes. Documented causative mutation types include missense, 
nonsense, copy number variation (CNV), frameshift deletions or insertions, and 
splicing variants.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was performed on a patient affected with BBS 
for whom no mutations were identified using clinically approved genetic testing 
of the known genes. Analysis of the WGS was done using internal protocols and 
publicly available algorithms. The phenotype was defined by retrospective chart 
review.
RESULTS: We document a female affected with BBS carrying the most common BBS1 
mutation (BBS1: Met390Arg) on the maternal allele and an insertion of a ~1.7-kb 
retrotransposon in exon 13 on the paternal allele. This retrotransposon 
insertion was not automatically annotated by the standard variant calling 
protocols used. This novel variant was identified by visual inspection of the 
alignment file followed by specific genome analysis with an available algorithm 
for transposable elements.
CONCLUSION: This report documents a novel mutation type associated with BBS and 
highlights the importance of systematically performing transposon detection 
analysis on WGS data of unsolved cases.

Adult-onset neuropsychiatric diseases are one of the most challenging areas of 
medicine. While symptomatic treatments are available, for most of these diseases 
the exact pathomechanism is not known, thus, disease-modifying therapies are 
difficult to conceptualize and find. The two most common and best studied 
neuropsychiatric diseases affecting higher cortical functions in humans are 
schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease; both diseases have high heritability, 
however, the genetic architecture is not fully elucidated. Robust Single 
Nucleotide Variant (SNV) studies have identified several loci with modest effect 
sizes. While Copy Number Variants (CNV) make an important contribution to 
genetic variation, CNV GWAS suffer from dependence on mainly SNP arrays with 
underperforming genotyping accuracy. We evaluated dynamic range of the assays 
for three types of CNV loci, including biallelic deletion, high copy gain, and 
fusion gene, to assess the depth of exploration of the contribution of CNVs to 
disease susceptibility. Despite the suboptimal genotyping, novel mechanisms are 
emerging and further large-scale studies with genotyping assays optimized for 
CNV detection are needed. Furthermore, the CHRFAM7A human-specific fusion gene 
association warrants large scale locus specific association studies in AD, 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and ADHD.

Submicroscopic chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs), such as deletions and 
duplications, account for about 15⁻20% of patients affected with developmental 
delay, intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, and autism 
spectrum disorder. Most of CNVs are de novo or inherited rearrangements with 
clinical relevance, but there are also rare inherited imbalances with unknown 
significance that make difficult the clinical management and genetic 
counselling. Chromosomal microarrays analysis (CMA) are recognized as the 
first-line test for CNV detection and are now routinely used in the clinical 
diagnostic laboratory. The recent use of CMA platforms that combine classic copy 
number analysis with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping has 
increased the diagnostic yields. Here we discuss the application of the Cytoscan 
high-density (HD) SNP-array for the detection of CNVs. We provide an overview of 
molecular analyses involved in identifying pathogenic CNVs and highlight 
important guidelines to establish pathogenicity of CNV.

The role of copy number variants (CNVs) in disease is now well established. In 
parallel NGS technologies, such as long-read technologies, there is continual 
development and data analysis methods continue to be refined. Clinical exome 
sequencing data is now a reality for many diagnostic laboratories in both 
congenital genetics and oncology. This provides the ability to detect and report 
both SNVs and structural variants, including CNVs, using a single assay for a 
wide range of patient cohorts. Areas covered: Currently, whole-genome sequencing 
is mainly restricted to research applications and clinical utility studies. 
Furthermore, detecting the full-size spectrum of CNVs as well as somatic events 
remains difficult for both exome and whole-genome sequencing. As a result, the 
full extent of genomic variants in an individual's genome is still largely 
unknown. Recently, new sequencing technologies have been introduced which 
maintain the long-range genomic context, aiding the detection of CNVs and 
structural variants. Expert commentary: The development of long-read sequencing 
promises to resolve many CNV and SV detection issues but is yet to become 
established. The current challenge for clinical CNV detection is how to fully 
exploit all the data which is generated by high throughput sequencing 
technologies.

BACKGROUND: Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a neurodegenerative disease, is 
occasionally accompanied by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and cystoid 
macular oedema. It is presently treated with repeated intravitreal injections of 
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. However, there are 
concerns regarding long-term inhibition of VEGF by the use of these agents, 
especially in cases involving neurodegenerative diseases, since VEGFs have a 
neuroprotective effect. Currently, there are no reports on the long-term safety 
of anti-VEGF therapy in patients with RP.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe the case of a 56-year-old female 
patient with CNV associated with RP who was treated with anti-VEGF therapy for 
8 years. She had autosomal dominant RP with a heterozygous PRPH2 mutation 
(c.410G > A) and complained of metamorphopsia in her left eye. Examinations 
revealed CNV with serous retinal detachment. She was treated with as-needed 
injections for 2 years; however, she experienced a recurrence. Therefore, we 
switched to a bimonthly regimen that was continued for 6 years. In total, the 
patient received 34 injections of various types of anti-VEGFs over 8 years. No 
recurrences were noted during that time, and we have not detected any negative 
effects concerning the progression of visual field loss in comparison with the 
fellow eye.
CONCLUSIONS: No negative effects related to the progression of visual field loss 
were observed during continuous treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 8 years in 
our patient.

Single-cell whole genome amplification (WGA) is a new technology, which can 
amplify small amounts of DNA from single cell and obtain the high coverage whole 
genome DNA template for revealing cell heterogeneity. Single cell WGA methods 
mainly include primer extension preamplification PCR (PEP-PCR), degenerate 
oligonucleotide primed PCR (DOP-PCR), multiple displacement amplification (MDA), 
and multiple annealing and looping-based amplification cycles (MALBAC). In this 
review, we describe the principles and applications of different single cell 
genome wide amplification, and we evaluate and compare their amplification 
efficiency, including the coverage of genome, homogeneity, reproducibility, and 
detection power of single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and copy number variants 
(CNV). The results show that MALBAC have the highest amplification homogeneity, 
the lowest allelic gene knockdown rate, the best reproducibility, and the best 
detection effect on CNV and SNV. We also describe the applications of MALBAC in 
human single sperm meiosis, aneuploidy analysis, and human oocyte genome 
research.

Recurrent deletions of the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B genes encoded at chromosome 9p21 
have been described in both pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL), but their prognostic value remains controversial, with limited data on 
adult T-ALL. Here, we investigated the presence of homozygous and heterozygous 
deletions of the CDKN2A/ARF and CDKN2B genes in 64 adult T-ALL patients enrolled 
in two consecutive trials from the Spanish PETHEMA group. Alterations in 
CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B were detected in 35/64 patients (55%). Most of them consisted 
of 9p21 losses involving homozygous deletions of the CDKNA/ARF gene (26/64), as 
confirmed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and interphase 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH). Deletions involving the 
CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B locus correlated with a higher frequency of cortical T cell 
phenotype and a better clearance of minimal residual disease (MRD) after 
induction therapy. Moreover, the combination of an altered copy-number-value 
(CNV) involving the CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B gene locus and undetectable MRD (≤ 0.01%) 
values allowed the identification of a subset of T-ALL with better overall 
survival in the absence of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are profound in cancer genomes at 
different stages: oncogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Accurate detection 
and characterization of SCNA landscape at genome-wide scale are of great 
importance. Next-generation sequencing and SNP array are current technology of 
choice for SCNA analysis. They are able to quantify SCNA with high resolution 
and meanwhile raise great challenges in data analysis. To this end, we have 
developed an R package saasCNV for SCNA analysis using (1) whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS), (2) whole-exome sequencing (WES) or (3) whole-genome SNP array 
data. In this chapter, we provide the features of the package and step-by-step 
instructions in detail.

Copy number variation (CNV) in insect genomes is a rich source of potentially 
adaptive polymorphism which may help overcome the constraints of purifying 
selection on conserved genes and/or permit elevated transcription. Classic 
studies of amplified esterases and acetylcholinesterase duplication in Culex 
pipiens quantified evolutionary dynamics of CNV driven by insecticidal 
selection. A more complex and potentially medically impactful form of CNV is 
found in Anopheles gambiae, with both heterogeneous duplications and homogeneous 
amplifications strongly linked with insecticide resistance. Metabolic gene 
amplification, revealed by shotgun sequencing, appears common in Aedes aegypti, 
but poorly understood in other mosquito species. Many methodologies have been 
used to detect CNV in mosquitoes, but relatively few can detect both 
duplications and amplifications, and contrasting methods should be combined. 
Genome scans for CNV have been rare to date in mosquitoes, but offer immense 
potential to determine the overall role of CNV as a component of resistance 
mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Elevated PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, a context associated with 
an adaptive immune response, has been linked to the total burden of copy number 
variants (CNVs) in aneuploid tumors, to microsatellite instability (MSI), and to 
specific genomic driver lesions, including loss of PTEN, MYC amplification, and 
activating mutations in driver oncogenes such as KRAS and PIK3CA. 
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) typically have high levels of CNVs and 
diverse driver lesions in their genomes. Thus, there is significant interest in 
exploiting genomic data to develop predictive immunotherapy biomarkers for 
patients with TNBC.
METHODS: Whole tissue samples from 55 resected TNBCs were screened by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PD-1 and PD-L1 by using validated antibodies and 
established scoring methods for staining of tumor and non-tumor cells. In 
parallel, we interrogated biopsies from each resection with DNA content flow 
cytometry and sorted the nuclei of diploid, tetraploid, and aneuploid cell 
populations. CNVs were mapped with CNV oligonucleotide arrays by using purified 
(>95%) tumor populations. We generated whole exome data for 12 sorted tumor 
samples to increase the resolution within loci of interest and to incorporate 
somatic mutations into our genomic signatures.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 staining was detected on tumor cells in 29 out of 
54 (54%) evaluable cases and was associated with increased overall survival 
(P = 0.0024). High levels of PD-1 and PD-L1 (IHC ≥4) were present in 11 out of 
54 (20%) and 20 out of 54 (37%) cases with staining of PD-L1 primarily on tumor 
cells for 17 out of 20 (85%) cases. The latter included tumors with both high 
(>50) and low (<20) numbers of CNVs. Notably, homozygous deletion of PTEN 
(n = 6) or activating mutation in PIK3CA (n = 1) was not associated with 
increased expression of either immune checkpoint activator in TNBC. In contrast, 
two treatment-naïve cases with EGFR driver amplicons had high PD-L1 tumor 
staining. High mutational load and predicted neoepitopes were observed in MSI+ 
and high CNV burden TNBCs but were not associated with high PD-L1 expression on 
tumor cells. Our results challenge current models of genomic-based immunotherapy 
signatures yet suggest that discrete genomic lesions may complement existing 
biomarkers to advance immune checkpoint therapies for patients with TNBC.

In 2004, the implementation of array comparative genomic hybridization (array 
comparative genome hybridization [CGH]) into clinical practice marked a new 
milestone for genetic diagnosis. Array CGH and single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) arrays enable genome-wide detection of copy number changes in a high 
resolution, and therefore microarray has been recognized as the first-tier test 
for patients with intellectual disability or multiple congenital anomalies, and 
has also been applied prenatally for detection of clinically relevant copy 
number variations in the fetus. Area covered: In this review, the authors 
summarize the evolution of array CGH technology from their diagnostic 
laboratory, highlighting exonic SNP arrays developed in the past decade which 
detect small intragenic copy number changes as well as large DNA segments for 
the region of heterozygosity. The applications of array CGH to human diseases 
with different modes of inheritance with the emphasis on autosomal recessive 
disorders are discussed. Expert commentary: An exonic array is a powerful and 
most efficient clinical tool in detecting genome wide small copy number variants 
in both dominant and recessive disorders. However, whole-genome sequencing may 
become the single integrated platform for detection of copy number changes, 
single-nucleotide changes as well as balanced chromosomal rearrangements in the 
near future.

Copy number variation (CNV) is a phenomenon in which sections of the genome, 
ranging from one kilo base pair (Kb) to several million base pairs (Mb), are 
repeated and the number of repeats vary between the individuals in a population. 
It is an important source of genetic variation in an individual which is now 
being utilized rather than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as it covers 
the more genomic region. CNVs alter the gene expression and change the phenotype 
of an individual due to deletion and duplication of genes in the copy number 
variation regions (CNVRs). Earlier, researchers extensively utilized SNPs as the 
main source of genetic variation. But now, the focus is on identification of 
CNVs associated with complex traits. With the recent advances and reduction in 
the cost of sequencing, arrays are developed for genotyping which cover the 
maximum number of SNPs at a time that can be used for detection of CNVRs and 
underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the complex traits to accelerate 
genetic improvement. CNV studies are also being carried out to understand the 
evolutionary mechanism in the domestication of livestock and their adaptation to 
the different environmental conditions. The main aim of the study is to review 
the available data on CNV and its role in genetic variation among the livestock.

Outcome of 5-Year Treatment of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration With 
Intravitreal Anti-VEGF Using "Treat and Extend" Regimen.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is twofold. First, to evaluate the long-term 
outcome of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment in a 
clinical setting using the "treat-and-extend regimen" (TER) in patients with 
neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Second, to determine the 
proportion of patients treated with anti-VEGF with good visual acuity (VA), 
i.e., vision sufficient to maintain a high level of independence.
DESIGN: We conducted a single center retrospective review of patients with 
treatment-naive nAMD who were treated with anti-VEGF. Patients were treated with 
anti-VEGF intravitreal injections according to the TER. Patients started 
treatment with monthly injections of either bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) or 
ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 mL) until there were no signs present of choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) activity. CNV activity was determined from fundus 
examination and SD-OCT imaging. Follow-up administration of intravitreal 
injections was extended by 2-week intervals, up to a total of 14 weeks, provided 
no signs of CNV activity were detected. In some patients, the first treatment 
was replaced with aflibercept (2 mg/0.05 mL).
PARTICIPANTS: On the basis of the inclusion criterion for the study, that 
patients had to be treated for 5 years, a total of 101 patients were included in 
the study. In all patients, one eye was treated for a 5-year period, and thus we 
studied 101 eyes.
MEASUREMENTS: Best corrected VA was analyzed at baseline and each year during 
the 5-year follow-up.
RESULTS: VA improved initially after year 1 of the treatment. VA decreased in 
the subsequent 4 years of treatment, but remained significantly higher from year 
1 to year 3 of the treatment compared to baseline values. Patients with good VA 
followed a similar trend: the proportion increased in the first year, and 
thereafter gradually decreased during the course of the 5-year follow up. At 
year 5, the number of patients with good VA decreased to baseline values.
CONCLUSION: TER with anti-VEGF for nAMD treatment prevents long-term severe 
visual loss in real-world setting and maintains patients' VA at levels 
sufficient to ensure independence.

BACKGROUND: By identifying pathogenic variants across hundreds of genes, 
expanded carrier screening (ECS) enables prospective parents to assess the risk 
of transmitting an autosomal recessive or X-linked condition. Detection of 
at-risk couples depends on the number of conditions tested, the prevalence of 
the respective diseases, and the screen's analytical sensitivity for identifying 
disease-causing variants. Disease-level analytical sensitivity is often <100% in 
ECS tests because copy number variants (CNVs) are typically not interrogated 
because of their technical complexity.
METHODS: We present an analytical validation and preliminary clinical 
characterization of a 235-gene sequencing-based ECS with full coverage across 
coding regions, targeted assessment of pathogenic noncoding variants, panel-wide 
CNV calling, and specialized assays for technically challenging genes. 
Next-generation sequencing, customized bioinformatics, and expert manual call 
review were used to identify single-nucleotide variants, short insertions and 
deletions, and CNVs for all genes except FMR1 and those whose low disease 
incidence or high technical complexity precluded novel variant identification or 
interpretation.
RESULTS: Screening of 36859 patients' blood or saliva samples revealed the 
substantial impact on fetal disease-risk detection attributable to novel CNVs 
(9.19% of risk) and technically challenging conditions (20.2% of risk), such as 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Of the 7498 couples screened, 335 were 
identified as at risk for an affected pregnancy, underscoring the clinical 
importance of the test. Validation of our ECS demonstrated >99% analytical 
sensitivity and >99% analytical specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Validated high-fidelity identification of different variant 
types-especially for diseases with complicated molecular genetics-maximizes 
at-risk couple detection.

Copy Number Variation Disorders.

Shaikh TH(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Section of Clinical Genetics and Metabolism, 
University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO 80045.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Copy number variation (CNV) disorders arise from the dosage 
imbalance of one or more gene(s), resulting from deletions, duplications or 
other genomic rearrangements that lead to the loss or gain of genetic material. 
Several disorders, characterized by multiple birth defects and 
neurodevelopmental abnormalities, have been associated with relatively large (>1 
Mb) and often recurrent CNVs. CNVs have also been implicated in the etiology of 
neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia as well as other 
common complex diseases. Thus, CNVs have a significant impact on human health 
and disease.
RECENT FINDINGS: The use of increasingly higher resolution, genomewide analysis 
has greatly enhanced the detection of genetic variation, including CNVs. 
Furthermore, the availability of comprehensive genetic variation data from large 
cohorts of healthy controls has the potential to greatly improve the 
identification of disease associated genetic variants in patient samples.
SUMMARY: This review discusses the current knowledge about CNV disorders, 
including the mechanisms underlying their formation and phenotypic outcomes, and 
the advantages and limitations of current methods of detection and disease 
association.

Optical coherence tomography angiography is one of the biggest advances in 
ophthalmic imaging. It enables a depth-resolved assessment of the retinal and 
choroidal blood flow, far exceeding the levels of detail commonly obtained with 
dye angiographies. One of the first applications of optical coherence tomography 
angiography was in detecting the presence of choroidal neovascularization in 
age-related macular degeneration and establishing its position in relation to 
the retinal pigmented epithelium and Bruch's membrane, and thereby classifying 
the CNV as type 1, type 2, type 3, or mixed lesions. Optical coherence 
tomography angiograms, due to the longer wavelength used by optical coherence 
tomography, showed a more distinct choroidal neovascularization vascular pattern 
than fluorescein angiography, since there is less suffering from light 
scattering or is less obscured by overlying subretinal hemorrhages or exudation. 
Qualitative and quantitative assessments of optical coherence tomography 
angiography findings in exudative and nonexudative age-related macular 
degeneration have been largely investigated within the past 3 years both in 
clinical and experimental settings. This review constitutes an up-to-date of all 
the potential applications of optical coherence tomography angiography in 
age-related macular degeneration in order to better understand how to translate 
its theoretical usefulness into the current clinical practice.

Optical coherence tomography angiography in the management of age-related 
macular degeneration.

Schneider EW(1), Fowler SC.

Author information:
(1)Tennessee Retina PC, Nashville, Tenessiville, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) provides 
rapid, flow-based imaging of the retinal and choroidal vasculature in a 
noninvasive manner. This review contrasts this novel technique with conventional 
angiography and discusses its current uses and limitations in the management of 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Initial work with OCT-A has focused on its ability to identify 
choriocapillaris flow alterations in dry AMD and to sensitively detect choroidal 
neovascular membranes (CNVs) in neovascular AMD. Reduced choriocapillaris flow 
beyond the borders of geographic atrophy seen on OCT-A suggests a primary 
vascular cause in geographic atrophy. Longitudinal OCT-A analysis of CNV 
morphology has demonstrated the transition from an immature to mature CNV 
phenotype following treatment. Current clinical applications of OCT-A include 
identification of asymptomatic CNV and monitoring for CNV development in the 
setting of an acquired vitelliform lesion.
SUMMARY: OCT-A remains a promising diagnostic tool but one still very much in 
evolution. Larger studies will be needed to more accurately describe its 
sensitivity and specificity for CNV detection and to better characterize 
longitudinal CNV morphologic changes. Anticipated hardware and software updates 
including swept-source light sources, automated montaging, and manual adjustment 
of interscan timing should enhance the capabilities of OCT-A in the management 
of AMD.

As a major biomarker of liquid biopsy, cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA), which can be 
extracted from blood, urine, or other circulating liquids, is able to provide 
comprehensive genetic information of tumor and better overcome the tumor 
heterogeneity problem comparing to tissue biopsy. Developed in recent years, 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a widely used technology for analyzing 
ctDNA. Although the technologies of processing ctDNA samples are mature, the 
task to detect low mutated allele frequency (MAF) variations from noisy 
sequencing data remains challenging. In this chapter, the authors will first 
explain the difficulties of analyzing ctDNA sequencing data, review related 
technologies, and then present some novel bioinformatics methods for analyzing 
ctDNA NGS data in better ways.

BACKGROUND: Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) are common 
structurally abnormal chromosomes that occur in 0.288% of cases of mental 
retardation. Isodicentric 15 (idic(15)) is common in sSMCs and usually leads to 
a rare chromosome disorder with distinctive clinical phenotypes, including early 
central hypotonia, developmental delay, epilepsy, and autistic behavior. It was 
previously shown that the partial tetrasomy 15q and partial hexasomy 15q 
syndromes are usually caused by one and two extra idic(15), respectively. 
Karyotypes containing a mosaic partial octosomy 15q resulting from three extra 
idic(15) have rarely been reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: Two patients with profound intellectual impairment, 
development delay and hyperpigmentation were recruited for this study. The 
phenotype was relatively more severe in patient 1 than in patient 2. 
Conventional cytogenetic analysis of peripheral blood obtained from patients 1 
and 2 revealed rare mosaic karyotypes containing sSMCs, i.e., mos 
49,XX,+mar × 3[83]/48,XX,+mar × 2[7]/46,XX[10] and mos 
48,XX,+mar × 2[72]/47,XX,+mar[28], respectively. The results of analyses of copy 
number variation (CNV) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses, 
showed that the sSMCs were found to be idic(15) involving the 
Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndrome Critical Region (PWACR) genes and the P gene, 
with duplication sizes of 6.3 Mb and 9.7 Mb, respectively. DNA fingerprinting 
analysis of patient 1 showed a maternal origin for the idic(15). Both patients 
had mosaic idic(15) karyotypes: patient 1 had cells with a 15q partial octosomy 
(83%), and patient 2 had cells with a 15q partial hexasomy (72%).
CONCLUSIONS: We detected two rare mosaic idic(15) karyotypes that were 
associated with congenital abnormalities, including a rare mosaic octosomy of 
15q11-q13. Our cases further validate the notion that the phenotypic severity is 
correlated with the level of mosaicism and the dosage effect of related genes in 
the proximal 15q.

OBJECTIVE: To study the utility of genetic evaluation and testing in patients 
with suspected fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).
STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients (n = 36) 
referred for evaluation for suspected FASD to the genetics clinic at Boston 
Children's Hospital between January 2006 and January 2013. Records of all 
patients were reviewed to obtain the medical history, family history, 
examination findings, and investigations, including genetic testing.
RESULTS: Of the 36 patients, definite prenatal exposure was documented in 69%. 
Eight patients did not fulfill clinical criteria for FASD. Chromosomal 
microarray analysis (CMA) detected 19 copy number variants (CNVs) in 14 
patients. Among patients who fulfilled criteria for FASD and underwent CMA, 
pathogenic CNVs were detected in 3 patients (2q37del, 22q11.22dup, and 
4q31.21del syndromes), giving a yield of 14.3%. All 3 patients had overlapping 
features between FASD and the genetic syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Genetic testing, especially CMA, should be considered in patients 
referred for evaluation of FASD, as a significant proportion have a clinically 
significant CNV even when they fulfill diagnostic criteria for FASD spectrum.

Atypical fibroxanthomas (AFX) and pleomorphic dermal sarcomas (PDS) are frequent 
cutaneous sarcomas typically arising on sun-exposed skin in elderly patients. In 
contrast to AFX, which generally do not recur after complete excision, PDS 
locally recur in up to 50% and metastasize in up to 20%. We recently detected 
characteristic UV-induced TP53 mutations as potential driver mutation in almost 
all PDS investigated as well as activating PIK3CA and RAS gene mutations in 
around one third of our tumors representing targets for personalized treatments 
in patients with unresectable or metastasized PDS. In the present study, we 
identified amplifications and deletions in a small part of the PDS (6 of 27 
cases) but not in AFX suggesting that copy number variations (CNV) might not be 
an initial event in tumor development but rather important during tumor 
progression. In addition to BRAF, KNSTRN, IDH1 and PDGFRA amplification, CNV 
analyses revealed deletions in the CDKN2A, KIT and PDGFRA genes. In cases where 
an appropriate FISH assay was established, the CNV results could be verified by 
FISH analysis. Amplification of BRAF, KIT or PDGFRA and/or losses of CDKN2A 
might represent bad prognostic markers, although larger studies are needed to 
clarify their association with prognosis or progression in PDS.

OCT Angiography: An Upcoming Non-invasive Tool for Diagnosis of Age-related 
Macular Degeneration.

Roisman L, Goldhardt R.

PURPOSE: To review the most recent findings, characteristics, faults and future 
perspectives of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD).
RECENT FINDINGS: In dry AMD, OCTA is useful on the evaluation of 
choriocapillaris perfusion and detection of naïve quiescent non-exudative 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In wet AMD, OCTA can provide detailed 
anatomic and morphologic information of CNVs, which may help to understand why 
and how they develop and become active. In other hand, the many artifacts 
present in OCTA images may lead to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis.
SUMMARY: OCTA is a still developing technology that is able to provide a large 
amount of anatomic, functional and morphologic information in macular diseases 
and, particularly, AMD. As the technology evolves, the need of dye-based 
modalities tends to decrease.

Molecular methods, by which copy number variants (CNVs) detection is available, 
have been gradually introduced into routine diagnostics over the last 15 years. 
Despite this, some CNVs continue to be a huge challenge when it comes to 
clinical interpretation. CNVs are an important source of normal and pathogenic 
variants, but, in many cases, their impact on human health depends on factors 
that are not yet known. Therefore, perception of their clinical consequences can 
change over time, as our knowledge grows. This review summarises guidelines that 
facilitate correct classification of identified changes and discusses 
difficulties with the interpretation of rare, small CNVs.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the role of 
genomic disorders in various psychiatric conditions and to highlight important 
recent advances in the field that are of potential clinical relevance.
RECENT FINDINGS: Genomic disorders are caused by large rare recurrent deletions 
and duplications at certain chromosomal "hotspots" (e.g., 22q11.2, 16p11.2, 
15q11-q13, 1q21.1, 15q13.3) across the genome. Most overlap multiple genes, 
affect development, and are associated with variable cognitive and other 
neuropsychiatric expression. Although individually rare, genomic disorders 
collectively account for a significant minority of intellectual disability, 
autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Genome-wide chromosomal microarray 
analysis is capable of detecting all genomic disorders in a single test, 
offering the first opportunity for routine clinical genetic testing in 
psychiatric practice.

Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China.

Chromosome copy number variants (CNVs; gains and losses of DNA sequences >1 kb) 
are wide-spread throughout the genome of healthy individuals. Laboratory studies 
show that a subset of CNVs are pathogenic, and not only can be responsible for 
the pathogenesis of major birth defects and cancer, but are also associated with 
neurodevelopmental disorders at birth. The characteristics of the pathogenic 
microdeletions and microduplications are important for both clinical 
implications and genetic counselling regarding test selection for prenatal 
screening and diagnosis. Unfortunately, our knowledge of the phenotypic effects 
of most CNV is still minimal, leading to the classification of many CNVs as 
"genomic imbalances of unknown clinical significance". Microdeletions and 
microduplications can occur in all pregnancies and the spectrum of pathogenic 
CNVs in fetuses with syndromic malformations is not well studied. This review 
summarizes our current understanding of CNVs, the common detection methods, and 
the characteristics of pathogenic CNVs identified in fetuses with syndromic 
malformations. Birth Defects Research 109:725-733, 2017. © 2017 Wiley

OBJECTIVE: To establish, based on a systematic literature review, the frequency 
of pathogenic submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations in fetuses that are not at 
increased risk for unbalanced structural chromosomal aberrations, with the aim 
of determining whether high-resolution testing for submicroscopic aberrations is 
beneficial in a general pregnant population.
METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases were searched 
systematically on 3 June 2016 for all relevant articles on the prevalence of 
pathogenic submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs) in fetuses referred for 
prenatal invasive testing because of advanced maternal age (AMA) or parental 
anxiety (ANX). Relevant full-text articles were analyzed and the prevalence of 
submicroscopic CNVs was calculated based on the extracted data. Meta-analysis 
was conducted in a pooled cohort of 10 614 fetuses based on the 10 largest 
studies (n > 300) of a total of 19 that were relevant.
RESULTS: Pooled estimate analysis indicated that 0.84% (95% CI, 0.55-1.30%) of 
fetuses that had invasive testing because of AMA/ANX carried a pathogenic 
clinically significant submicroscopic aberration. The onset/penetrance of 
submicroscopic findings was studied in 10 314 fetuses reported in eight papers 
that presented aberrant cases with all necessary details to allow assessment of 
the findings. The pooled estimates resulting from meta-analysis of the data 
indicated that an early-onset syndromic disorder was detected in 0.37% (95% CI, 
0.27-0.52%) of cases, a susceptibility CNV was found in 0.30% (95% CI, 
0.14-0.67%) and late-onset diseases were reported in 0.11% (95% CI, 
0.05%-0.21%). The prevalence of early-onset syndromic disorders caused by a 
submicroscopic aberration was calculated to be 1:270. When the risk for 
submicroscopic aberrations is added to the individual risk for microscopic 
chromosomal aberrations, all pregnant women have a risk of higher than 1 in 180 
for a relevant chromosomal aberration, and pregnant women under 36 years of age 
have a higher risk for submicroscopic pathogenic aberrations than for Down 
syndrome.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review shows that a significant proportion of 
fetuses in a general pregnant population carry a submicroscopic pathogenic CNV. 
Based on these figures, all women should be informed on their individual risk 
for all pathogenic chromosomal aberrations and not only for common trisomies.

143. Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Drugs for the Treatment of Retinal 
Conditions: A Review of the Safety [Internet].

Deonandan R, Jones S.

Ottawa (ON): Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health; 2017 Feb 28.
CADTH Rapid Response Reports.

Retinal conditions, such as age related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic 
macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and choroidal 
neovascularization due to pathologic myopia (CNV due to PM) are an important 
public health concern that threatens the vision of millions of patients in 
Canada. The mechanism of these conditions involve the new formation of blood 
vessels in the retina that eventually leads to loss of vision. Anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor (Anti-VEGF) inhibits this growth and allows the 
restoration of vision. Currently in Canada, two licensed anti-VEGF agents are 
available in the market; ranibizumab and aflibercept. Bevacizumab, on the other 
hand, has been developed as an anti-cancer drug. However, its close molecular 
resemblance to ranibizumab and identical mechanism of action has made it a 
widely used option, especially in environments that are strained on health 
resources., However, despite the wide use of bevacizumab for retinal conditions, 
and the availability of several high-quality randomized controlled trials for 
its efficacy, Bevacizumab still lacks a Health Canada review for retinal 
indications. The bevacizumab product monograph carries a warning regarding the 
intravitreal use of bevacizumab, citing increased risk of ophthalmic 
complications. In addition, the intravenous use of bevacizumab in cancer 
patients is often associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events (e.g. 
stroke). The CADTH therapeutic review titled “Anti–Vascular Endothelial Growth 
Factor Drugs for the Treatment of Retinal Conditions” established that the 
efficacy of bevacizumab is not different than ranibizumab or aflibercept, and 
did not observe any signals indicating issues regarding bevacizumab comparative 
safety. However, the CADTH recommendation report for the therapeutic review 
identifies the lack of large randomized trials powered to detect differences in 
harms outcomes as a research gap. The statistical power required to detect a 
difference in harms outcome can make a randomized clinical trial prohibitive. A 
review of available evidence regarding safety of bevacizumab from real-world 
evidence is of high clinical value, as it represents a useful tool for 
identifying any potential issues regarding the safety of bevacizumab for use in 
treating retinal conditions. A summary and critical appraisal of studies 
regarding bevacizumab safety, contrasted with those of ranibizumab and 
aflibercept, for the treatment of retinal conditions would allow for a more 
informed and evidence-based policy and clinical decision process.

Chromosomal Microarrays: Understanding Genetics of Neurodevelopmental Disorders 
and Congenital Anomalies.

College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States.

Chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, used to identify DNA copy number 
variations (CNVs), has helped advance knowledge about genetics of human 
neurodevelopmental disease and congenital anomalies. It has aided in discovering 
new CNV syndromes and uncovering disease genes. It has discovered CNVs that are 
not fully penetrant and/or cause a spectrum of phenotypes, including 
intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and dysmorphisms. Such CNVs can 
pose challenges to genetic counseling. They also have helped increase knowledge 
of genetic risk factors for neurodevelopmental disease and raised awareness of 
possible shared etiologies among these variable phenotypes. Advances in CMA 
technology allow CNV identification at increasingly finer scales, improving 
detection of pathogenic changes, although these sometimes are difficult to 
distinguish from normal population variation. This paper confronts some of the 
challenges uncovered by CMA testing while reviewing advances in genetics and the 
clinical use of this test that has replaced standard karyotyping in most genetic 
evaluations.

BACKGROUND: Current pathways for testing fetuses at increased risk of a 
chromosomal anomaly because of an ultrasound anomaly involve karyotyping after 
rapid aneuploidy exclusion. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) may detect more 
clinically significant chromosomal imbalances than karyotyping but evidence to 
guide UK health service providers on whether or not CMA should replace 
karyotyping is limited.
OBJECTIVES: (1) To compare detection rates of copy number variants (CNVs) and 
laboratory turnaround times (TATs) by karyotyping and CMA in fetuses with 
ultrasound anomalies, (2) to calculate test costs and the cost per additional 
pathogenic CNV detected by CMA relative to karyotyping and (3) to determine what 
factors influence parents’ and health professionals’ choice and decision-making 
about CMA.
DESIGN: A multicentre experimental research cohort study with an additional cost 
analysis.
SETTING: A total of 20 fetal medicine units and nine cytogenetic laboratories 
across England and Wales.
PARTICIPANTS: Women with a fetus undergoing quantitative fluorescent polymerase 
chain reaction (QF-PCR) and karyotyping for clinical indications with (1) one or 
more structural anomalies identified on ultrasound or (2) an isolated nuchal 
translucency (NT) of ≥ 3.5 mm.
INTERVENTIONS: Karyotyping and CMA after exclusion of major chromosomal 
anomalies by QF-PCR. The array design consisted of 8-plex 60,000 60-mer 
oligonucleotides with a backbone resolution of ≈75 kb.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of abnormal karyotypes and pathogenic CNVs and 
variants of unknown significance on CMA. Laboratory TATs for karyotyping and 
CMA. Costs of karyotyping and CMA and cost per additional pathogenic CNV 
detected by CMA. Parent and health professional attitudes to CMA.
RESULTS: Out of the 1718 probands recruited, 1123 cases with normal QF-PCR and 
both karyotype and CMA were available for analysis. In the group with structural 
anomalies (n = 629), CMA detected more CNVs [6.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
4.4% to 9.3%] and more pathogenic CNVs (3.5%, 95% CI 1.5% to 5.5%) than 
karyotyping. In the increased NT group (n = 494), CMA detected more CNVs (4.5%, 
95% CI 1.8% to 7.1%) than karyotyping but not more pathogenic CNVs. Compared 
with karyotyping, median TAT was 3 days [interquartile range (IQR) 0–13 days] 
longer with CMA but when actual set-up to reporting times were compared, CMA was 
5 days (IQR 2–8 days) quicker. Cost calculations of the respective pathways 
indicated that, per patient, CMA is on average £113 more costly than 
karyotyping. The incremental cost per extra pathogenic CNV detected by CMA was 
greater in the increased NT than the structural anomaly group (£9439 vs. £3635). 
Qualitative evaluation suggested that parents find CMA acceptable, despite the 
uncertainties it may introduce, and that in the main it is acceptable to health 
professionals and commissioners.
CONCLUSIONS: CMA is a robust, acceptable and probably cost-effective method to 
detect more clinically significant chromosomal imbalances in the anomalous 
fetus. The results suggest that CMA should replace karyotyping in these care 
pathways.
FUTURE WORK: The application of CMA (and exome sequencing) on cell-free DNA in 
maternal plasma.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN01058191.
FUNDING: This project was funded by the Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation 
programme, a MRC and NIHR partnership. The funder had no role in the 
identification, design and conduct of the study and the reporting of the 
analysis. The funder did recommend the inclusion of the cell-free DNA aspects of 
the EACH study. Funding was also received from the Great Ormond Street 
Biomedical Research Centre.

Chromosomal microarray detected more fetal anomalies than karyotyping, was 
acceptable to professionals and patients, and although more costly is likely to 
be cost-effective.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and still untreatable motor 
neuron disease. Despite the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS pathogenesis 
that are still far from being understood, several studies have suggested the 
importance of a genetic contribution in both familial and sporadic forms of the 
disease. In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which account 
for only a limited number of ALS cases, a consistent number of common and rare 
copy number variations (CNVs) have been associated to ALS. Most of the CNV-based 
association studies use a traditional candidate-gene approach that is inadequate 
for uncovering the genetic architectures of complex traits like ALS. The 
emergent paradigm of "systems biology" may offer a new perspective to better 
interpret the wide spectrum of CNVs in ALS, enabling the characterization of the 
complex network of gene products underlying ALS pathogenesis. In this review, we 
will explore the landscape of CNVs in ALS, putting specific emphasis on the 
functional impact of common CNV regions and genes consistently associated with 
increased risk of developing disease. In addition, we will discuss the potential 
contribution of multiple rare CNVs in ALS pathogenesis, focusing our attention 
on the complex mechanisms by which these proteins might impact, individually or 
in combination, the genetic susceptibility of ALS. The comprehensive detection 
and functional characterization of common and rare candidate risk CNVs in ALS 
susceptibility may bring new pieces into the intricate mosaic of ALS 
pathogenesis, providing interesting and important implications for a more 
precise molecular biomarker-assisted diagnosis and more effective and 
personalized treatments.

Early diagnosis and treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a main 
cause of severe vision loss in age related macular degeneration (AMD), is 
crucial in order to preserve vision and the quality of life of patients. This 
review summarizes current literature on the subject of early detection of CNV, 
both in the clinic setting and mainly in the patient's home. New technologies 
are evolving to allow for earlier detection and thus vision preservation in AMD 
patients.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a macromolecule recognition 
technology based on the complementary nature of DNA or DNA/RNA double strands. 
Selected DNA strands incorporated with fluorophore-coupled nucleotides can be 
used as probes to hybridize onto the complementary sequences in tested cells and 
tissues and then visualized through a fluorescence microscope or an imaging 
system. This technology was initially developed as a physical mapping tool to 
delineate genes within chromosomes. Its high analytical resolution to a single 
gene level and high sensitivity and specificity enabled an immediate application 
for genetic diagnosis of constitutional common aneuploidies, 
microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, and subtelomeric rearrangements. FISH 
tests using panels of gene-specific probes for somatic recurrent losses, gains, 
and translocations have been routinely applied for hematologic and solid tumors 
and are one of the fastest-growing areas in cancer diagnosis. FISH has also been 
used to detect infectious microbias and parasites like malaria in human blood 
cells. Recent advances in FISH technology involve various methods for improving 
probe labeling efficiency and the use of super resolution imaging systems for 
direct visualization of intra-nuclear chromosomal organization and profiling of 
RNA transcription in single cells. Cas9-mediated FISH (CASFISH) allowed in situ 
labeling of repetitive sequences and single-copy sequences without the 
disruption of nuclear genomic organization in fixed or living cells. Using 
oligopaint-FISH and super-resolution imaging enabled in situ visualization of 
chromosome haplotypes from differentially specified single-nucleotide 
polymorphism loci. Single molecule RNA FISH (smRNA-FISH) using combinatorial 
labeling or sequential barcoding by multiple round of hybridization were applied 
to measure mRNA expression of multiple genes within single cells. Research 
applications of these single molecule single cells DNA and RNA FISH techniques 
have visualized intra-nuclear genomic structure and sub-cellular transcriptional 
dynamics of many genes and revealed their functions in various biological 
processes.

There has been a huge acceleration in our technical ability to detect variation 
in the human genome in recent years, and there has been a corresponding effort 
in clinical diagnostic laboratories to take advantage of this progress for the 
benefit of patients. There has, however, not been an equivalent increase in our 
understanding of human genetics and disease, not for lack of effort but due to 
the far greater complexity of understanding variation than the difficulties of 
detecting it. This chapter describes how software tools can be used to target 
clinical genetic diagnostic testing in order to exploit technical and scientific 
advances both efficiently and cost-effectively, while maximizing clinical 
utility.

DNA structure alterations are the ultimate source of genetic variations. Without 
them, evolution would be impossible. While they are essential for DNA diversity, 
defects in DNA synthesis can lead to numerous genetic diseases. Due to 
increasingly innovative technologies, our knowledge of the human genome and 
genetic diseases has grown considerably over the last few years, allowing us to 
detect another class of variants affecting the chromosomal structure. DNA 
sequence can be altered in multiple ways: DNA sequence changes by substitution, 
deletion, or duplication of some nucleotides; chromosomal structure alterations 
by deletion, duplication, translocation, and inversion, ranging in size from 
kilobases to mega bases; changes in the cell's genome size. If the alteration is 
located within a gene and sufficiently deleterious, it can cause genetic 
disorders. Due to the F8 gene's high rate of new small mutations and its 
location at the tip of X chromosome, containing high repetitive sequences, a 
wide variety of genetic variants has been described as the cause of hemophilia A 
(HA). In addition to the F8 intron 22 repeat inversion, HA can also result from 
point mutations, other inversions, complex rearrangements, such as duplications 
or deletions, and transposon insertions causing phenotypes of variable severity 
characterized by complete or partial deficiency of circulating FVIII. This 
review aims to present the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of F8 
alterations. A sound understanding of the multiple genetic mechanisms 
responsible for HA is essential to determine the appropriate strategy for 
molecular diagnosis and detected each type of genetic variant.

Copy Number Variations Detection: Unravelling the Problem in Tangible Aspects.

do Nascimento F, Guimaraes KS.

In the midst of the important genomic variants associated to the susceptibility 
and resistance to complex diseases, Copy Number Variations (CNV) has emerged as 
a prevalent class of structural variation. Following the flood of 
next-generation sequencing data, numerous tools publicly available have been 
developed to provide computational strategies to identify CNV at improved 
accuracy. This review goes beyond scrutinizing the main approaches widely used 
for structural variants detection in general, including Split-Read, Paired-End 
Mapping, Read-Depth, and Assembly-based. In this paper, (1) we characterize the 
relevant technical details around the detection of CNV, which can affect the 
estimation of breakpoints and number of copies, (2) we pinpoint the most 
important insights related to GC-content and mappability biases, and (3) we 
discuss the paramount caveats in the tools evaluation process. The points 
brought out in this study emphasize common assumptions, a variety of possible 
limitations, valuable insights, and directions for desirable contributions to 
the state-of-the-art in CNV detection tools.

Mutations in CRIPT encoding cysteine-rich PDZ domain-binding protein are rare, 
and to date have been reported in only two patients with autosomal recessive 
primordial dwarfism and distinctive facies. Here, we describe a female with 
biallelic mutations in CRIPT presenting with postnatal growth retardation, 
global developmental delay, and dysmorphic features including frontal bossing, 
high forehead, and sparse hair and eyebrows. Additional clinical features 
included high myopia, admixed hyper- and hypopigmented macules primarily on the 
face, arms, and legs, and syndactyly of 4-5 toes bilaterally. Using whole exome 
sequencing (WES) and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), we detected a c.8G>A 
(p.C3Y) missense variant in exon 1 of the CRIPT gene inherited from the mother 
and a 1,331 bp deletion encompassing exon 1, inherited from the father. The 
c.8G>A (p.C3Y) missense variant in CRIPT was apparently homozygous in the 
proband due to the exon 1 deletion. Our findings illustrate the clinical utility 
of combining WES with copy number variant (CNV) analysis to provide a molecular 
diagnosis to patients with rare Mendelian disorders. Our findings also 
illustrate the clinical spectrum of CRIPT related mutations. © 2016 Wiley

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Retinal Diseases.

Chalam KV(1), Sambhav K(1).

Author information:

Florida, USA.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new, non-invasive imaging 
system that generates volumetric data of retinal and choroidal layers. It has 
the ability to show both structural and blood flow information. Split-spectrum 
amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm (a vital component of OCTA 
software) helps to decrease the signal to noise ratio of flow detection thus 
enhancing visualization of retinal vasculature using motion contrast. Published 
studies describe potential efficacy for OCTA in the evaluation of common 
ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age related macular 
degeneration (AMD), retinal vascular occlusions and sickle cell disease. OCTA 
provides a detailed view of the retinal vasculature, which allows accurate 
delineation of microvascular abnormalities in diabetic eyes and vascular 
occlusions. It helps quantify vascular compromise depending upon the severity of 
diabetic retinopathy. OCTA can also elucidate the presence of choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) in wet AMD. In this paper, we review the knowledge, 
available in English language publications regarding OCTA, and compare it with 
the conventional angiographic standard, fluorescein angiography (FA). Finally, 
we summarize its potential applications to retinal vascular diseases. Its 
current limitations include a relatively small field of view, inability to show 
leakage, and tendency for image artifacts. Further larger studies will define 
OCTA's utility in clinical settings and establish if the technology may offer a 
non-invasive option of visualizing the retinal vasculature, enabling us to 
decrease morbidity through early detection and intervention in retinal diseases.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography of Choroidal Neovascularization 
Secondary to Pathologic Myopia.

Querques G, Corvi F, Querques L, Souied EH, Bandello F.

PURPOSE: To analyze the ability of optical coherence tomography angiography 
(OCT-A) to detect the presence of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and 
to describe structural features of myopic CNV on OCT-A.
METHODS: Patients with CNV secondary to high myopia (>6 diopters and >26 mm 
axial length) underwent multimodal imaging, including multicolor imaging, 
fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain (SD)-OCT and OCT-A. The OCT-A features 
of CNV were analyzed and correlated with the angiography and SD-OCT findings.
RESULTS: On OCTA, the CNV appeared as a large hyperintense vascular anastomotic 
network at the edge of the lesion. On the basis of the OCT-A images and reports 
in the literature, we propose the following two terms for describing myopic CNV 
characteristics: 'interlacing' and 'tangled' vascular networks.
CONCLUSION: OCT-A is a very useful tool for the diagnosis and evaluation of CNV 
complicating high myopia; however, it does not appear to be sufficient when used 
alone and should be considered for use in combination with SD-OCT and 
conventional angiography.

The neuro-behavioral disorder of autism was first described in the 1940s and was 
predicted to have a biological basis. Since that time, with the growth of 
genetic investigations particularly in the area of pediatric development, an 
increasing number of children with autism and related disorders (autistic 
spectrum disorders, ASD) have been the subject of genetic studies both in the 
clinical setting and in the wider research environment. However, a full 
understanding of the biological basis of ASDs has yet to be achieved. Early 
observations of children with chromosomal abnormalities detected by G-banded 
chromosome analysis (karyotyping) and in situ hybridization revealed, in some 
cases, ASD associated with other features arising from such an abnormality. The 
introduction of higher resolution techniques for whole genome screening, such as 
array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH), allowed smaller imbalances to be 
detected, some of which are now considered to represent autism susceptibility 
loci. In this review, we describe some of the work underpinning the conclusion 
that ASDs have a genetic basis; a brief history of the developments in genetic 
analysis tools over the last 50 years; and the most common chromosome 
abnormalities found in association with ASDs. Introduction of next generation 
sequencing (NGS) into the clinical diagnostic setting is likely to provide 
further insights into this complex field but will not be covered in this review.

Vascularization of Irregular Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachments in Chronic 
Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Evaluated With OCT Angiography.

de Carlo TE, Rosenblatt A, Goldstein M, Baumal CR, Loewenstein A, Duker JS.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To assess eyes with flat, irregular retinal pigment 
epithelial detachments (RPEDs) associated with central serous chorioretinopathy 
(CSCR) for choroidal neovascularization (CNV) using optical coherence tomography 
angiography (OCTA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of OCTA images of chronic CSCR eyes 
with irregular RPED (group 1) and regular RPED (controls, group 2) for presence 
of CNV, subretinal fluid, and intraretinal fluid. Fluorescein angiography was 
also evaluated for CNV.
RESULTS: CNV was detected using OCTA in 13 of 31 eyes (41.9%) in group 1 and in 
one of 18 eyes (5.6%) in group 2 (P = .007). Irregular RPED was a risk factor 
for CNV (odds ratio [OR] = 12.28; 95% CI, 1.45-104.3). There was no significant 
difference between detection by OCTA and FA (P = 1.0). Sensitivity and 
specificity of detection by OCTA were 85.7% and 95.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Irregular RPEDs in chronic CSCR eyes may harbor neovascularization 
more often than previously thought, which has implications on therapy.

syndrome.

Genomic disruptions, altered epigenetic mechanisms, and environmental factors 
contribute to the heterogeneity of congenital heart defects (CHD). In recent 
years, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) has led to the identification of 
numerous copy number variations (CNV) in patients with CHD. Genes disrupted by 
and within these CNVs thus represent excellent candidate genes for CHD. 
Microduplications of 9q (9q+) have been described in patients with CHD, however, 
the critical gene locus remains undetermined. Here we discuss an infant with 
tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve, fetal hydrops, and a 3.76 Mb de 
novo contiguous gain of 9q34.2-q34.3 detected by CMA, and confirmed by karyotype 
and FISH studies. This duplicated interval disrupted RXRA (retinoid X receptor 
alpha; OMIM #180245) at intron 1. We also review CHD findings among previously 
reported patients with 9q (9q+) duplication syndrome. This is the first report 
implicating RXRA in CHD with 9q duplication, providing additional data in 
understanding the genetic etiology of tetralogy of Fallot, CHD, and disorders 
linked to 9q microduplication syndrome. This report also highlights the 
significance of CMA in the clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling of patients 
and families with complex CHD.

INTRODUCTION: The global prevalence of pathologic myopia is 0.9-3.1%, and visual 
impairment is found in 0.1-0.5% of European and 0.2-1.4% of Asian studies. 
Myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) affects 5.2-11.3% of pathologic 
myopia patients and is a leading cause of vision impairment in the working-age 
population. Characteristic morphological changes and visual-acuity decrease are 
diagnostic features. Vascular-Endothelial-Growth-Factor (VEGF) has been 
identified as a trigger for pathologic neovascularization in these highly myopic 
patients.
AREAS COVERED: We cover the epidemiology, pathology and diagnostic aspects of 
mCNV. The history of therapeutic interventions is described, followed by an 
overview of current standard-of-care (SOC)-blocking VEGF using bevacizumab 
(off-label), ranibizumab or aflibercept and improving vision up to 13.5-14.4 
letters. Despite good efficacy, an unmet medical need remains. We summarize 
ongoing and future developments of new drugs to treat or potentially cure mCNV.
EXPERT OPINION: mCNV is a major global health concern. Early detection and 
treatment is key for a satisfying outcome. The current SOC, VEGF inhibitors, 
affords good therapeutic efficacy and reasonable disease stabilization with few 
intravitreal treatments per year. However, the long-term prognosis is still 
unsatisfactory, and side-effects like chorioretinal atrophy development are of 
concern. Therefore, efforts should be intensified to develop more effective 
therapies.

BACKGROUND: One of the most important somatic aberrations, copy number 
variations (CNVs) in tumor genomes is believed to have a high probability of 
harboring oncotargets. Detection of somatic CNVs is an essential part of cancer 
genome sequencing analysis, but the accuracy is usually limited due to various 
factors. A post-processing procedure including manual review and refinement of 
CNV segments is often needed in practice to achieve better accuracy.
RESULTS: cnvCurator is a user-friendly tool with functions specifically designed 
to facilitate the process of interactively visualizing and editing somatic CNV 
calling results. Different from other general genomics viewers, the index and 
display of CNV calling results in cnvCurator is segment central. It incorporates 
multiple CNV-specific information for concurrent, interactive display, as well 
as a number of relevant features allowing user to examine and curate the CNV 
calls.
CONCLUSIONS: cnvCurator provides important and practical utilities to assist the 
manual review and edition of results from a chosen somatic CNV caller, such that 
curated CNV segments will be used for down-stream applications.

Contrasting mechanisms of de novo copy number mutagenesis suggest the existence 
of different classes of environmental copy number mutagens.

Function, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.

While gene copy number variations (CNVs) are abundant in the human genome, and 
often are associated with disease consequences, the mutagenic pathways and 
environmental exposures that cause these large structural mutations are 
understudied relative to conventional nucleotide substitutions in DNA. The 
members of the environmental mutagenesis community are currently seeking to 
remedy this deficiency, and there is a renewed interest in the development of 
mutagenicity assays to identify and characterize compounds that may induce de 
novo CNVs in humans. To achieve this goal, it is critically important to 
acknowledge that CNVs exist in two very distinct classes: nonrecurrent and 
recurrent CNVs. The goal of this commentary is to emphasize the deep contrasts 
that exist between the proposed pathways that lead to these two mutation 
classes. Nonrecurrent de novo CNVs originate primarily in mitotic cells through 
replication-dependent DNA repair pathways that involve microhomologies (<10 bp), 
and are detected at higher frequency in children of older fathers. In contrast, 
recurrent de novo CNVs are most often formed in meiotic cells through homologous 
recombination between nonallelic large low-copy repeats (>10,000 bp), without an 
associated paternal age effect. Given the biological differences between the two 
CNV classes, it is our belief that nonrecurrent and recurrent CN mutagens will 
probably differ substantially in their modes of action. Therefore, each CNV 
class may require their own uniquely designed assays, so that we as a field may 
succeed in uncovering the broadest possible spectrum of environmental CN 
mutagens.

Exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing for the detection of copy number 
variation.

Many laboratories now use genomic microarrays as their first-tier diagnostic 
test for copy number variation (CNV) detection. In addition, whole exome 
sequencing is increasingly being offered as a diagnostic test for heterogeneous 
disorders. Although mostly used for the detection of point mutations and small 
insertion-deletions, exome sequencing can also be used to call CNVs, allowing 
combined small and large variant analysis. Whole genome sequencing in addition 
to these advantages also offers the potential to characterize CNVs to 
unprecedented levels of accuracy, providing position and orientation 
information. In this review, we discuss the clinical potential of CNV 
identification in whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing data and 
the implications this has on diagnostic laboratories.

Gastric cancer and gene copy number variation: emerging cancer drivers for 
targeted therapy.

Shanghai, China.

Gastric cancer (GC) is among the most common malignancy in the world with poor 
prognosis and limited treatment options. It has been established that gastric 
carcinogenesis is caused by a complex interaction between host and environmental 
factors. Copy number variation (CNV) refers to a form of genomic structural 
variation that results in abnormal gene copy numbers, including gene 
amplification, gain, loss and deletion. DNA CNV is an important influential 
factor for the expression of both protein-coding and non-coding genes, affecting 
the activity of various signaling pathways. CNV arises as a result of 
preferential selection that favors cancer development, and thus, targeting the 
amplified 'driver genes' in GC may provide novel opportunities for personalized 
therapy. The detection of CNVs in chromosomal or mitochondrial DNA from tissue 
or blood samples may assist the diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy of GC. 
In this review, we discuss the recent CNV discoveries that shed light on the 
molecular pathogenesis of GC, with a specific emphasis on CNVs that display 
diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic significances in GC.

In the perinatal setting, chromosome imbalances cause a range of clinically 
significant disorders and increase the risk for other particular phenotypes. As 
technologies have improved to detect increasingly smaller deletions and 
duplications, collectively referred to as copy number variants (CNVs), 
clinicians are learning the significant role that these types of genomic 
variants play in human disease and their high frequency in ∼ 1% of all 
pregnancies. This article highlights key aspects of CNV detection and 
interpretation used during the course of clinical care in the prenatal and 
neonatal periods. Early diagnosis and accurate interpretation are important for 
targeted clinical management.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of array-based comparative genomic hybridization 
(array-CGH) for analyzing tissues derived from spontaneous abortion and 
stillbirth.
METHODS: Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray 4×44 K chip and Affymetrix Cytoscan 
750 K Array were utilized to detect genome-wide copy number variations (CNV) in 
43 fetuses with spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. All identified CNV were 
analyzed with references from Database of Genomic variants (DGV), database of 
DECIPHER, ISCA and OMIM, as well as comprehensive literature review to determine 
whether the identified CNVs were pathogenic. Parental DNA of two cases was also 
analyzed with the same arrays for pathogenic or unknown significant CNVs.
RESULTS: All of the 43 specimens were successfully analyzed. Clinically 
significant chromosomal aberrations were identified in 32 (74.4%) of the 
samples, which included 26 aneuploidies and 10 pathogenic CNV.
CONCLUSION: Array-CGH is a fast and effective method for analyzing tissues 
derived from spontaneous abortions and stillbirths which may be difficult to 
culture for karyotype analysis.

Human genetic variation is represented by the genetic differences both within 
and among populations, and most genetic variants do not cause overt diseases but 
contribute to disease susceptibility and influence drug response. During the 
last century, various genetic variants, such as copy number variations (CNVs), 
have been associated with diverse human disorders. Here, we review studies on 
the associations between CNVs and autoimmune diseases to gain some insight. 
First, some CNV loci are commonly implicated in various autoimmune diseases, 
such as Fcγ receptors in patients with systemic lupus erythemoatosus or 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and β-defensin genes in patients with 
psoriasis or Crohn's disease. This means that when a CNV locus is associated 
with a particular autoimmune disease, we should examine its potential 
associations with other diseases. Second, interpopulation or interethnic 
differences in the effects of CNVs on phenotypes exist, including disease 
susceptibility, and evidence suggests that CNVs are important to understand 
susceptibility to and pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. However, many 
findings need to be replicated in independent populations and different ethnic 
groups. The validity and reliability of detecting CNVs will improve quickly as 
genotyping technology advances, which will support the required replication.

Tremendous advances in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and high-throughput 
omics methods have brought us one step closer towards mechanistic understanding 
of the complex disease at the molecular level. In this review, we discuss four 
basic regulatory mechanisms implicated in complex genetic diseases, such as 
cancer, neurological disorders, heart disease, diabetes, and many others. The 
mechanisms, including genetic variations, copy-number variations, 
posttranscriptional variations, and epigenetic variations, can be detected using 
a variety of NGS methods. We propose that malfunctions detected in these 
mechanisms are not necessarily independent, since these malfunctions are often 
found associated with the same disease and targeting the same gene, group of 
genes, or functional pathway. As an example, we discuss possible rewiring 
effects of the cancer-associated genetic, structural, and posttranscriptional 
variations on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network centered around P53 
protein. The review highlights multi-layered complexity of common genetic 
disorders and suggests that integration of NGS and omics data is a critical step 
in developing new computational methods capable of deciphering this complexity.

BACKGROUND: Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is currently the most widely 
adopted clinical test for patients with unexplained intellectual disability 
(ID), developmental delay (DD), and congenital anomalies. Its use has revealed 
the capacity to detect copy number variants (CNVs), as well as regions of 
homozygosity, that, based on their distribution on chromosomes, indicate 
uniparental disomy or parental consanguinity that is suggestive of an increased 
probability of recessive disease.
RESULTS: We screened 149 Lebanese probands with ID/DD and 99 healthy controls 
using the Affymetrix Cyto 2.7 M and SNP6.0 arrays. We report all identified 
CNVs, which we divided into groups. Pathogenic CNVs were identified in 12.1% of 
the patients. We review the genotype/phenotype correlation in a patient with a 
1q44 microdeletion and refine the minimal critical regions responsible for the 
10q26 and 16q monosomy syndromes. Several likely causative CNVs were also 
detected, including new homozygous microdeletions (9p23p24.1, 10q25.2, and 
8p23.1) in 3 patients born to consanguineous parents, involving potential 
candidate genes. However, the clinical interpretation of several other CNVs 
remains uncertain, including a microdeletion affecting ATRNL1. This CNV of 
unknown significance was inherited from the patient's unaffected-mother; 
therefore, additional ethnically matched controls must be screened to obtain 
enough evidence for classification of this CNV.
CONCLUSION: This study has provided supporting evidence that whole-genome 
analysis is a powerful method for uncovering chromosomal imbalances, regardless 
of consanguinity in the parents of patients and despite the challenge presented 
by analyzing some CNVs.

Accumulating evidence indicates that DNA copy number variation (CNV) is likely 
to make a significant contribution to human diversity and also play an important 
role in disease susceptibility. Recent advances in genome sequencing 
technologies have enabled the characterization of a variety of genomic features, 
including CNVs. This has led to the development of several bioinformatics 
approaches to detect CNVs from next-generation sequencing data. Here, we review 
recent advances in CNV detection from whole genome sequencing. We discuss the 
informatics approaches and current computational tools that have been developed 
as well as their strengths and limitations. This review will assist researchers 
and analysts in choosing the most suitable tools for CNV analysis as well as 
provide suggestions for new directions in future development.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of spectral-domain optical 
coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration 
(nAMD): a comparison against fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA).
METHODS: A retrospective review of SD-OCT, colour fundus photographs (FP), and 
FFA of 411 consecutive patients referred to a rapid access Macular Clinic over a 
4-year period was performed. FFA images were reviewed non-stereoscopically. 
SD-OCT images were acquired using the Topcon 3D OCT-1000 instrument. All FFA and 
OCT images were graded by at least two ophthalmologists independently. 
Side-by-side grading took place with immediate open discussion and adjudication. 
If there was disagreement between the two grading ophthalmologists or they were 
not 90% confident of their assigned grade, then adjudication by a third 
ophthalmologist was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 278 eyes were graded as having choroidal neovascularisation 
(CNV) with SD-OCT and 231 diagnosed with FFA. The main diagnostic CNV 
classifications on FFA were: classic no occult in 27 eyes, predominantly classic 
in 16, minimally classic in 50, occult in 129, and 9 peripapillary membranes. 
There were a total of 47 false positives with SD-OCT: a rate of 16.9%. The 
sensitivity and specificity of SD-OCT alone for detecting CNV was 100 and 80.8%, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirms SD-OCT in comparison to the reference standard of 
non-stereoscopic FFA is highly sensitive at detecting newly presenting nAMD in 
the setting of a specialist AMD clinic where the investigations are interpreted 
by trained specialists. However, it does not seem accurate enough to replace FFA 
in the diagnosis on nAMD in current practice.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new, non-invasive imaging 
technique that generates volumetric angiography images in a matter of seconds. 
This is a nascent technology with a potential wide applicability for retinal 
vascular disease. At present, level 1 evidence of the technology's clinical 
applications doesn't exist. In this paper, we introduce the technology, review 
the available English language publications regarding OCTA, and compare it with 
the current angiographic gold standards, fluorescein angiography (FA) and 
indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Finally we summarize its potential 
application to retinal vascular diseases. OCTA is quick and non-invasive, and 
provides volumetric data with the clinical capability of specifically localizing 
and delineating pathology along with the ability to show both structural and 
blood flow information in tandem. Its current limitations include a relatively 
small field of view, inability to show leakage, and proclivity for image 
artifact due to patient movement/blinking. Published studies hint at OCTA's 
potential efficacy in the evaluation of common ophthalmologic diseases such age 
related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, artery and vein 
occlusions, and glaucoma. OCTA can detect changes in choroidal blood vessel flow 
and can elucidate the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a 
variety of conditions but especially in AMD. It provides a highly detailed view 
of the retinal vasculature, which allows for accurate delineation of the foveal 
avascular zone (FAZ) in diabetic eyes and detection of subtle microvascular 
abnormalities in diabetic and vascular occlusive eyes. Optic disc perfusion in 
glaucomatous eyes is notable as well on OCTA. Further studies are needed to more 
definitively determine OCTA's utility in the clinical setting and to establish 
if this technology may offer a non-invasive option of visualizing the retinal 
vasculature in detail.

PURPOSE: Our understanding of the relevance of peripheral retinal abnormalities 
to disease in general and in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 
particular is limited by the lack of detailed peripheral imaging studies. The 
purpose of this study was to develop image grading protocols suited to 
ultra-widefield imaging (UWFI) in an aged population.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of a random population sample in which UWFI was 
introduced at the 12-year review of the Reykjavik Eye Study in Iceland.
PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred seventy-six subjects 62 years of age or older.
METHODS: Ultra-widefield (up to 200°) color and autofluorescence images were 
obtained using the Optos P200CAF laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Optos plc, 
Dunfermline, Scotland). The images were graded at Moorfields Eye Hospital 
Reading Centre primarily based on the International Classification for AMD. 
Macular and peripheral changes were graded using a standardized grid developed 
for this imaging method.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of hard, crystalline, and soft 
drusen; retinal pigment epithelial changes; choroidal neovascularization (CNV); 
atrophy; and hypoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence were graded in the 
peripheral retina.
RESULTS: Of the eyes examined, 81.1% had AMD-like changes in the macula alone 
(13.6%), periphery alone (10.1%), and both periphery and macula (57.4%). There 
was no AMD-like CNV or pigment epithelial detachment in the periphery except in 
those cases in which these clearly originated from the macula. Seven patients 
had AMD-like atrophy in the periphery without end-stage disease in the macula. 
One patient with end-stage disease in the macula had normal periphery results on 
the color images. While analyzing the eyes, we detected pathologic appearances 
that were very reliably identified by graders.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotyping the retinal periphery using the categories defined by 
the International Classification confirmed the presence of wide-ranging AMD-like 
pathologic changes even in those without central sight-threatening macular 
disease. Based on our observations, we propose here new, reliably identifiable 
grading categories that may be more suited for population-based UWFI.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for fetal aneuploidy detection is 
increasingly being offered in the clinical setting. Whereas the majority of 
tests only report fetal trisomies 21, 18 and 13, genome-wide analyses have the 
potential to detect other fetal, as well as maternal, aneuploidies. In this 
review, we discuss the technical and clinical advantages and challenges 
associated with genome-wide cell-free fetal DNA profiling.

This article reviews clinically relevant data regarding punctate inner 
choroidopathy, mainly the various treatment options. Punctate inner 
choroidopathy is an uncommon, inflammatory, multifocal chorioretinopathy 
affecting mostly young myopic women. It is characterized by the presence of 
multiple, small, well-defined, yellow-white fundus lesions, in the absence of 
intraocular inflammation. We describe etiology, clinical findings and ancillary 
tests that help in the diagnosis and detection of complications. Treatment 
options that have been used to manage patients with PIC and CNV include 
immunosuppressants, corticoids, laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy, 
intravitreal anti-VEGF agents and submacular surgery.

Somatic alterations in DNA copy number have been well studied in numerous 
malignancies, yet the role of germline DNA copy number variation in cancer is 
still emerging. Genotyping microarrays generate allele-specific signal 
intensities to determine genotype, but may also be used to infer DNA copy number 
using additional computational approaches. Numerous tools have been developed to 
analyze Illumina genotype microarray data for copy number variant (CNV) 
discovery, although commonly utilized algorithms freely available to the public 
employ approaches based upon the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs). QuantiSNP, 
PennCNV, and GenoCN utilize HMMs with six copy number states but vary in how 
transition and emission probabilities are calculated. Performance of these CNV 
detection algorithms has been shown to be variable between both genotyping 
platforms and data sets, although HMM approaches generally outperform other 
current methods. Low sensitivity is prevalent with HMM-based algorithms, 
suggesting the need for continued improvement in CNV detection methodologies.

OBJECTIVE: To find a potential underlying cause for 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS) discordance in monozygotic 
twins.
DESIGN: Prospective comparative study.
SETTING: University hospital.
PATIENT(S): Our study genetically analyzed 5 MRKHS-discordant monozygotic twin 
pairs with the unique opportunity to include saliva and rudimentary uterine 
tissue.
INTERVENTION(S): Blood, saliva, or rudimentary uterine tissue from five 
MRKHS-discordant twins was analyzed and compared between twin pairs as well as 
within the same individual where applicable. We used copy number variations 
(CNVs) to identify differences.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): CNVs in blood, rudimentary uterine tissue, and saliva, 
network analysis, and review of the literature.
RESULT(S): One duplication found in the affected twin included two genes, matrix 
metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related 
protein 10 (LRP10), which have known functions in the embryonic development of 
the uterus and endometrium. The duplicated region was detected in rudimentary 
uterine tissue from the same individual but not in saliva, making a 
tissue-specific mosaicism a possible explanation for twin discordance. 
Additional network analysis revealed important connections to differentially 
expressed genes from previous studies. These genes encode several molecules 
involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and neoangiogenesis.
CONCLUSION(S): MMP-14, LRP-10, ECM, and neoangiogenesis genes are identified as 
candidate genes in a tissue-specific mosaicism. The detected clusters provide 
evidence of deficient vascularization during uterine development and/or 
disturbed reorganization of ECM components, potentially during müllerian duct 
elongation signaled by the embryologically relevant phosphatidylinositol 
3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway. Therefore, we consider these genes to be new 
candidates in the manifestation of MRKHS.

There is evidence demonstrating that genetic factors contribute to the risk of 
diabetic retinopathy (DR). Genetics variants, structural variants (copy number 
variation, CNV) and epigenetic changes play important roles in the development 
of DR. Genetic linkage and association studies have uncovered a number of 
genetic loci and common genetic variants susceptibility to DR. CNV and 
interactions of gene by environment have also been detected by association 
analysis. Apart from nucleus genome, mitochondrial DNA plays critical roles in 
regulation of development of DR. Epigenetic studies have indicated epigenetic 
changes in chromatin affecting gene transcription in response to environmental 
stimuli, which provided a large body of evidence of regulating development of 
diabetes mellitus. Identification of genetic variants and epigenetic changes 
contributed to risk or protection of DR will benefit uncovering the complex 
mechanism underlying DR. This review focused on the current knowledge of the 
genetic and epigenetic basis of DR.

BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of 
uncorrectable severe vision loss in people aged 55 years and older in the 
developed world. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to neovascular AMD 
accounts for most AMD-related severe vision loss. Anti-vascular endothelial 
growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents, injected intravitreally, aim to block the 
growth of abnormal blood vessels in the eye to prevent vision loss and, in some 
instances, improve vision.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate: (1) the ocular and systemic effects of, and quality 
of life associated with, intravitreally injected anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, 
ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) for the treatment of neovascular AMD compared with 
no anti-VEGF treatment; and (2) the relative effects of one anti-VEGF agent 
compared with another when administered in comparable dosages and regimens.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
(CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) 
(2014, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed 
Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2014), 
EMBASE (January 1980 to March 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health 
Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to March 2014), the 
metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), 
ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization 
(WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) 
(www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We used no date or language restrictions in the 
electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 27 
March 2014.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that 
evaluated pegaptanib, ranibizumab, or bevacizumab versus each other or a control 
treatment (e.g., sham treatment or photodynamic therapy). All trials followed 
participants for at least one year.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened records, 
extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We contacted trial authors for 
additional data. We analyzed outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences 
(MDs). We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane 
Collaboration.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs including a total of 5496 participants with 
neovascular AMD (the number of participants per trial ranged from 28 to 1208). 
One trial compared pegaptanib, three trials ranibizumab, and two trials 
bevacizumab versus controls; six trials compared bevacizumab with ranibizumab. 
Four trials were conducted by pharmaceutical companies; none of the eight 
studies which evaluated bevacizumab were funded by pharmaceutical companies. The 
trials were conducted at various centers across five continents (North and South 
America, Europe, Asia and Australia). The overall quality of the evidence was 
very good, with most trials having an overall low risk of bias.When compared 
with control treatments, participants who received any of the three anti-VEGF 
agents were more likely to have gained 15 letters or more of visual acuity, lost 
fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity, and had vision 20/200 or better after 
one year of follow up. Visual acuity outcomes after bevacizumab and ranibizumab 
were similar when the same regimens were compared in the same RCTs, despite the 
substantially lower cost for bevacizumab compared with ranibizumab. No trial 
directly compared pegaptanib with other anti-VEGF agents; however, when compared 
with controls, ranibizumab or bevacizumab yielded larger improvements in visual 
acuity outcomes than pegaptanib.Participants treated with anti-VEGFs showed 
improvements in morphologic outcomes (e.g., size of CNV or central retinal 
thickness) compared with participants not treated with anti-VEGF agents. There 
was less reduction in central retinal thickness among bevacizumab-treated 
participants than among ranibizumab-treated participants after one year (MD 
-13.97 μm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.52 to -1.41); however, this 
difference is within the range of measurement error and we did not interpret it 
as being clinically meaningful.Ocular inflammation and increased intraocular 
pressure after intravitreal injection were the most frequently reported serious 
ocular adverse events. Endophthalmitis was reported in fewer than 1% of 
anti-VEGF treated participants; no cases were reported in control groups. The 
occurrence of serious systemic adverse events was comparable across 
anti-VEGF-treated groups and control groups; however, the numbers of events and 
trial participants may have been insufficient to detect a meaningful difference 
between groups. Data for visual function, quality of life, and economic outcomes 
were sparsely measured and reported.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review indicate the effectiveness of 
anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab) in terms of 
maintaining visual acuity; ranibizumab and bevacizumab were also shown to 
improve visual acuity. The information available on the adverse effects of each 
medication do not suggest a higher incidence of potentially vision-threatening 
complications with intravitreal injection compared with control interventions; 
however, clinical trial sample sizes may not have been sufficient to detect rare 
safety outcomes. Research evaluating variable dosing regimens with anti-VEGF 
agents, effects of long-term use, combination therapies (e.g., anti-VEGF 
treatment plus photodynamic therapy), and other methods of delivering the agents 
should be incorporated into future Cochrane reviews.

Exome sequence read depth methods for identifying copy number changes.

Kadalayil L, Rafiq S, Rose-Zerilli MJ, Pengelly RJ, Parker H, Oscier D, 
Strefford JC, Tapper WJ, Gibson J, Ennis S, Collins A.

Copy number variants (CNVs) play important roles in a number of human diseases 
and in pharmacogenetics. Powerful methods exist for CNV detection in whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) data, but such data are costly to obtain. Many disease 
causal CNVs span or are found in genome coding regions (exons), which makes CNV 
detection using whole exome sequencing (WES) data attractive. If reliably 
validated against WGS-based CNVs, exome-derived CNVs have potential applications 
in a clinical setting. Several algorithms have been developed to exploit exome 
data for CNV detection and comparisons made to find the most suitable methods 
for particular data samples. The results are not consistent across studies. 
Here, we review some of the exome CNV detection methods based on depth of 
coverage profiles and examine their performance to identify problems 
contributing to discrepancies in published results. We also present a 
streamlined strategy that uses a single metric, the likelihood ratio, to compare 
exome methods, and we demonstrated its utility using the VarScan 2 and eXome 
Hidden Markov Model (XHMM) programs using paired normal and tumour exome data 
from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. We use array-based somatic CNV 
(SCNV) calls as a reference standard to compute prevalence-independent 
statistics, such as sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio, for 
validation of the exome-derived SCNVs. We also account for factors known to 
influence the performance of exome read depth methods, such as CNV size and 
frequency, while comparing our findings with published results.

Genomic research can lead to discoveries of copy number variations (CNVs) which 
can be a susceptibility factor for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The clinical 
translation is that this can improve the care of children with ASD. Chromosome 
microarray is now the first-tiered genetic investigation for ASD, with a 
detection rate exceeding conventional cytogenetics and any single gene testing. 
However, interpretation of the results is challenging and there is no consensus 
on "what" and "how much" to disclose. In this article, we will review how CNV 
studies have improved our understanding of ASD, the clinical applications, and 
related counseling issues. Future direction of autism genetic research is also 
discussed.

neovascularization.

Medical College, Wenzhou, People's Republic of China.

Age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia, ocular trauma, and other 
eye diseases can cause choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In recent years, 
photodynamic therapy (PDT), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) 
medications, laser treatment, and other measures against CNV have been gradually 
applied in the clinical setting and in some cases have achieved good results. 
However, the pathogenesis of CNV has not been fully elucidated. The 
costimulatory system made up of cluster of differentiation 40 protein (CD40) and 
its ligand (CD40L) is an important signal transduction pathway among immune 
cells. The activation of CD40 can also stimulate the secretion of a variety of 
angiogenic growth factors (eg, VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factors that 
might lead to CNV. The high level expression of CD40 and CD40L has been detected 
in CNV diseases. Interference with the CD40 signaling pathway may become a new 
target for CNV treatment. We review the relationship between CD40, CD40L, and 
CNV.

Recent studies in humans and other model organisms have demonstrated that 
structural variants (SVs) comprise a substantial proportion of variation among 
individuals of each species. Many of these variants have been linked to 
debilitating diseases in humans, thereby cementing the importance of refining 
methods for their detection. Despite progress in the field, reliable detection 
of SVs still remains a problem even for human subjects. Many of the underlying 
problems that make SVs difficult to detect in humans are amplified in livestock 
species, whose lower quality genome assemblies and incomplete gene annotation 
can often give rise to false positive SV discoveries. Regardless of the 
challenges, SV detection is just as important for livestock researchers as it is 
for human researchers, given that several productive traits and diseases have 
been linked to copy number variations (CNVs) in cattle, sheep, and pig. Already, 
there is evidence that many beneficial SVs have been artificially selected in 
livestock such as a duplication of the agouti signaling protein gene that causes 
white coat color in sheep. In this review, we will list current SV and CNV 
discoveries in livestock and discuss the problems that hinder routine discovery 
and tracking of these polymorphisms. We will also discuss the impacts of 
selective breeding on CNV and SV frequencies and mention how SV genotyping could 
be used in the future to improve genetic selection.

Computational tools for copy number variation (CNV) detection using 
next-generation sequencing data: features and perspectives.

Zhao M, Wang Q, Wang Q, Jia P, Zhao Z.

Copy number variation (CNV) is a prevalent form of critical genetic variation 
that leads to an abnormal number of copies of large genomic regions in a cell. 
Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or genotyping 
arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy 
number changes in genomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can 
be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). During the last several years, 
NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and 
diseased individuals. Correspondingly, the strong demand for NGS-based CNV 
analyses has fuelled development of numerous computational methods and tools for 
CNV detection. In this article, we review the recent advances in computational 
methods pertaining to CNV detection using whole genome and whole exome 
sequencing data. Additionally, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses and 
suggest directions for future development.

Since the introduction of high-resolution microarray technologies, it has become 
apparent that structural chromosomal rearrangements can lead to a wide variety 
of clinical manifestations, including developmental delay/intellectual 
disability (DD/ID). It has been shown previously that the diagnostic yield of 
genome-wide array-based identification of submicroscopic alterations in patients 
with ID varies widely and depends on the patient selection criteria. More 
attempts have recently been made to define the phenotypic clues of pathogenic 
copy number variants (CNVs). The aim of this study was to investigate a 
well-phenotyped cohort of patients with DD/ID and determine whether certain 
clinical features may serve as indicators for pathogenic CNVs. A retrospective 
analysis was conducted for patients with DD/ID (n = 211) who were tested using 
genome-wide chromosomal microarray technologies and a review of the clinical 
data was performed. Pathogenic CNVs were detected in 29 patients. In comparison 
with individuals who had normal molecular karyotyping results (n = 182), 
malformations of the musculoskeletal system; congenital malformations of the CNS 
(particularly hydrocephalus and congenital malformations of the corpus 
callosum); minor anomalies of the eye, face, and neck subgroup (particularly 
downward-slanting palpebral fissures, minor anomalies of the ear, and 
micrognathia); brachydactyly; and umbilical hernia were more common in patients 
with chromosomal alterations. A multivariate logistic regression analysis 
allowed the identification of three independent pathogenic CNV predictors: 
congenital malformations of the corpus callosum, minor anomalies of the ear, and 
brachydactyly. Insights into the chromosomal phenotype may help to increase the 
diagnostic yield of microarray technologies and sharpen the distinction between 
chromosomal alterations and other conditions.

Next generation sequencing (NGS), or massively paralleled sequencing, refers to 
a collective group of methods in which numerous sequencing reactions take place 
simultaneously, resulting in enormous amounts of sequencing data for a small 
fraction of the cost of Sanger sequencing. Typically short (50-250 bp), NGS 
reads are first mapped to a reference genome, and then variants are called from 
the mapped data. While most NGS applications focus on the detection of single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) or small insertions/deletions (indels), structural 
variation, including translocations, larger indels, and copy number variation 
(CNV), can be identified from the same data. Structural variation detection can 
be performed from whole genome NGS data or "targeted" data including exomes or 
gene panels. However, while targeted sequencing greatly increases sequencing 
coverage or depth of particular genes, it may introduce biases in the data that 
require specialized informatic analyses. In the past several years, there have 
been considerable advances in methods used to detect structural variation, and a 
full range of variants from SNVs to balanced translocations to CNV can now be 
detected with reasonable sensitivity from either whole genome or targeted NGS 
data. Such methods are being rapidly applied to clinical testing where they can 
supplement or in some cases replace conventional fluorescence in situ 
hybridization or array-based testing. Here we review some of the informatics 
approaches used to detect structural variation from NGS data.

DNA sequence variations include nucleotide substitution, deletion, insertion, 
translocation and inversion. Deletion or insertion of a large DNA segment in the 
genome, referred to as copy number variation (CNV), has caught the attention of 
many researchers recently. It is believed that CNVs contribute significantly to 
genome variability, and thus contribute to phenotypic variability. In chickens, 
genome-wide surveys with array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH), SNP chip 
detection or whole genome sequencing have revealed a large number of CNVs. A 
large portion of chicken CNVs involves protein coding or regulatory sequences. A 
few CNVs have been demonstrated to be the determinant factors for single gene 
traits, such as late-feathering, pea-comb and dermal hyperpigmentation. The 
phenotypic effects of the majority of chicken CNVs are to be delineated.

Accurate detection of somatic copy number variations (CNVs) is an essential part 
of cancer genome analysis, and plays an important role in oncotarget 
identifications. Next generation sequencing (NGS) holds the promise to 
revolutionize somatic CNV detection. In this review, we provide an overview of 
current analytic tools used for CNV detection in NGS-based cancer studies. We 
summarize the NGS data types used for CNV detection, decipher the principles for 
data preprocessing, segmentation, and interpretation, and discuss the challenges 
in somatic CNV detection. This review aims to provide a guide to the analytic 
tools used in NGS-based cancer CNV studies, and to discuss the important factors 
that researchers need to consider when analyzing NGS data for somatic CNV 
detections.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in 
those over the age of 50 years in the developed countries. The number is 
expected to increase by ∼1.5 fold over the next ten years due to an increase in 
aging population. One of the main measures of AMD severity is the analysis of 
drusen, pigmentary abnormalities, geographic atrophy (GA) and choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) from imaging based on color fundus photograph, optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) and other imaging modalities. Each of these imaging 
modalities has strengths and weaknesses for extracting individual AMD pathology 
and different imaging techniques are used in combination for capturing and/or 
quantification of different pathologies. Current dry AMD treatments cannot cure 
or reverse vision loss. However, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) 
showed that specific anti-oxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of 
progression from intermediate stages (defined as the presence of either many 
medium-sized drusen or one or more large drusen) to late AMD which allows for 
preventative strategies in properly identified patients. Thus identification of 
people with early stage AMD is important to design and implement preventative 
strategies for late AMD, and determine their cost-effectiveness. A mass 
screening facility with teleophthalmology or telemedicine in combination with 
computer-aided analysis for large rural-based communities may identify more 
individuals suitable for early stage AMD prevention. In this review, we discuss 
different imaging modalities that are currently being considered or used for 
screening AMD. In addition, we look into various automated and semi-automated 
computer-aided grading systems and related retinal image analysis techniques for 
drusen, geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization detection and/or 
quantification for measurement of AMD severity using these imaging modalities. 
We also review the existing telemedicine studies which include diagnosis and 
management of AMD, and how automated disease grading could benefit telemedicine. 
As there is no treatment for dry AMD and only early intervention can prevent the 
late AMD, we emphasize mass screening through a telemedicine platform to enable 
early detection of AMD. We also provide a comparative study between the imaging 
modalities and identify potential study areas for further improvement and future 
research direction in automated AMD grading and screening.

Invited review DNA copy number changes as diagnostic tools for lung cancer.

Bowcock AM.

Lung cancer usually presents as advanced stage disease and there is a need for 
early diagnosis so that appropriate treatments can be provided prior to tumour 
progression. Copy number variation is frequently detected in tumours and can 
contribute to tumour progression. This is because regions harbouring DNA 
imbalance can contain genes encoding critical proteins whose altered dosage 
contributes to the neoplastic process. Three copy number variations (CNVs) from 
chromosomes 3p26-p11.1 (loss), 3q26.2-29 (gain) and 6q25.3-24.3 (loss) have 
previously been described in individuals presenting with endobronchial squamous 
metaplasia. These CNVs were predictors of cancer diagnosed within 44 months with 
97% accuracy. An evaluation of this CNV-based classifier with an independent set 
of 12 samples (10 men and 2 women), each with a carcinoma in situ or invasive 
carcinoma at the same site at follow-up demonstrated 92% prediction accuracy. 
The negative predictive value of this classifier was 89%. The gain at 3q26.2-q29 
contributed the most to the classification, being present in virtually all 
lesions. This region harbours the PIK3CA gene and evaluation of the number of 
copies of this gene gave very similar results to those from array comparative 
genomic hybridisation. This type of test can be performed on sputum or bronchial 
brushings. Larger cohorts now need to be examined to confirm this finding and to 
possibly refine the regions of CNV. This type of approach paves the way for 
future molecular analyses to assist in selecting subjects with endobronchial 
squamous metaplastic or dysplastic lesions who might benefit from more 
aggressive therapeutic intervention or surveillance.

Genotype-phenotype analysis of at least 25 individuals with interstitial 16p13.3 
duplications defines a recognizable syndrome associated with duplication of a 
critical Rubinstein-Taybi region encompassing only the CREBBP gene. 
Nevertheless, variable or incompletely penetrant phenotype has been reported 
previously. We here report a case of a 5-year old boy with a recognizable 
phenotype of this syndrome, including intellectual disability, mild 
arthrogryposis, small and proximally implanted thumbs and characteristic facial 
features. In addition, growth delay, microcephaly and distinguishable structural 
brain MRI abnormalities were observed. A de novo 1.5 Mb interstitial duplication 
of 16p13.3 was detected by SNP-array and fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH). Short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP) analysis with marker D16S475 
indicated that the duplication was formed before maternal meiosis II. Our 
findings highlight the variable clinical features and further expand the 
phenotypic spectrum correlated with this lately proposed syndrome.

structural ultrasound abnormalities and a normal karyotype: a systematic review 
of the literature.

OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of submicroscopic genetic copy number 
variants (CNVs) in fetuses with a structural ultrasound anomaly (restricted to 
one anatomical system) and a normal karyotype. The aim was to determine the 
diagnostic and prognostic value of genomic array testing in these pregnancies.
METHODS: Embase and PubMed databases were systematically searched for all 
relevant articles on prevalence of pathogenic submicroscopic CNVs in fetuses 
with ultrasound anomalies. Reported cases were sorted into groups according to 
anatomical site of the detected ultrasound anomaly. The prevalence of causative 
submicroscopic CNVs was calculated for each group.
RESULTS: Combined data of the reviewed studies (n = 18) indicated that fetuses 
with an ultrasound anomaly restricted to one anatomical system (n = 2220) had a 
3.1-7.9% chance of carrying a causative submicroscopic CNV, depending on the 
anatomical system affected. This chance increased to 9.1% for fetuses with 
multiple ultrasound anomalies (n = 1139).
CONCLUSION: This review indicates that 3.1-7.9% of fetuses with a structural 
ultrasound anomaly restricted to one anatomical system and a normal karyotype 
will show a submicroscopic CNV, which explains its phenotype and provides 
information for fetal prognosis. Therefore, we conclude that microarray has 
considerable diagnostic and prognostic value in these pregnancies.

New ethical issues for genetic counseling in common mental disorders.

Gershon ES, Alliey-Rodriguez N.

Comment in
    Am J Psychiatry. 2014 May;171(5):584-5.

OBJECTIVE: Recent genetic findings of high-impact genetic variants in bipolar 
disorder, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) must lead to 
profound changes in genetic and family counseling. The authors present risk 
calculations, discuss the ethical implications of these findings, and outline 
the changes now required in the risk counseling process.
METHOD: The authors use data from recent mega-analyses and reviews of common and 
rare risk variants in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and ASD to calculate 
risks of illness based on genetic marker tests. They then consider new ethical 
issues in mental disorders presented by these risks, including within-family 
conflicts over genetic testing; effects of genetic discoveries on stigma, 
abortion, preimplantation procedures, and population screening for 
susceptibility; and genetic tests as a factor in marital choice.
RESULTS: New structural mutations (de novo copy number variants [CNVs], which 
are chromosomal microdeletions and micro-duplications) are present in 4%27% of 
patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ASD and can occur almost 
anywhere in the genome. For a person with a de novo CNV, the absolute risk of 
bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ASD is 14%, much higher than the population 
risk. Rare CNVs have also been identified that are generally not new mutations 
but constitute very high-effect risk factors, ranging up to 82%.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial minority of patients with bipolar disorder, 
schizophrenia, and ASD have high-impact detectable genetic events. This greatly 
changes psychiatric genetic counseling for these patients and families. A 
psychotherapeutic approach may be needed as a routine part of risk counseling, 
particularly for resolution of ethical issues and for within-family stigma and 
conflicts over genetic test results.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk, risk factors, and visual impact of choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) in uveitis cases.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Standardized medical record review at 5 tertiary centers.
RESULTS: Among 15,137 uveitic eyes (8868 patients), CNV was rare in the cases of 
anterior or intermediate uveitis. Among the 4041 eyes (2307 patients) with 
posterior uveitis or panuveitis, 81 (2.0%) had CNV at presentation. Risk factors 
included posterior uveitis in general and specific uveitis syndromes affecting 
the outer retina-retinal pigment epithelium-choroid interface. Among the 2364 
eyes (1357 patients) with posterior uveitis or panuveitis and free of CNV at the 
time of cohort entry, the cumulative 2-year incidence of CNV was 2.7% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.8% to 3.5%). Risk factors for incident CNV included 
currently active inflammation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.26 
to 3.60), preretinal neovascularization (aHR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.30 to 7.80), and 
prior diagnosis of CNV in the contralateral eye (aHR, 5.79; 95% CI, 2.77 to 
12.09). Among specific syndromes, the incidence was greater in 
Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (aHR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.52 to 7.46) and punctate 
inner choroiditis (aHR, 8.67; 95% CI, 2.83 to 26.54). Incident CNV was 
associated with a 2-line loss of visual acuity (+0.19 logarithm of the minimal 
angle of resolution units; 95% CI, 0.079 to 0.29) from the preceding visit.
CONCLUSIONS: CNV is an uncommon complication of uveitis associated with visual 
impairment that occurs more commonly in forms affecting the outer retina-retinal 
pigment epithelium-choroid interface, during periods of inflammatory activity, 
in association with preretinal neovascularization, and in second eyes of 
patients with unilateral CNV. Because CNV is treatable, a systematic approach to 
early detection in high-risk patients may be appropriate.

The Growing Importance of CNVs: New Insights for Detection and Clinical 
Interpretation.

Valsesia A(1), Macé A, Jacquemont S, Beckmann JS, Kutalik Z.

Differences between genomes can be due to single nucleotide variants, 
translocations, inversions, and copy number variants (CNVs, gain or loss of 
DNA). The latter can range from sub-microscopic events to complete chromosomal 
aneuploidies. Small CNVs are often benign but those larger than 500 kb are 
strongly associated with morbid consequences such as developmental disorders and 
cancer. Detecting CNVs within and between populations is essential to better 
understand the plasticity of our genome and to elucidate its possible 
contribution to disease. Hence there is a need for better-tailored and more 
robust tools for the detection and genome-wide analyses of CNVs. While a link 
between a given CNV and a disease may have often been established, the relative 
CNV contribution to disease progression and impact on drug response is not 
necessarily understood. In this review we discuss the progress, challenges, and 
limitations that occur at different stages of CNV analysis from the detection 
(using DNA microarrays and next-generation sequencing) and identification of 
recurrent CNVs to the association with phenotypes. We emphasize the importance 
of germline CNVs and propose strategies to aid clinicians to better interpret 
structural variations and assess their clinical implications.

Genes and environments in schizophrenia: The different pieces of a manifold 
puzzle.

Genetic research targeting schizophrenia has undergone tremendous development 
during recent years. Supported by recently developed high-throughput genotyping 
technologies, both rare and common genetic variants have been identified that 
show consistent association with schizophrenia. These results have been 
replicated by independent studies and refined in meta-analyses. The genetic 
variation uncovered consists of common alleles, i.e. single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) conveying small effects (odds ratios below 1.1) on disease 
risk. The source of rare variants is copy number variations (CNVs), only 
detectable in a small proportion of patients (3-5% for all known CNVs) with 
schizophrenia, furthermore extremely rare de novo mutations captured by next 
generation sequencing, the most recent technological advancement in the field. 
Despite these findings, the search for the genetic architecture underlying 
schizophrenia continues since these variants explain only a small proportion of 
the overall phenotypic variance. Gene-environment interactions provide a 
compelling model for resolving this paradox and interpreting the risk factors of 
schizophrenia. Epidemiologically proven risk factors, such as prenatal 
infection, obstetric complications, urbanicity, cannabis, and trauma have been 
demonstrated to interact with genetic risk, giving rise to higher prevalence 
rates or more severe symptomatology in individuals with direct or indirect 
genetic predisposition for schizophrenia. Further research will have to explain 
how the different forms of genetic variation interact and how environmental 
factors modulate their effects. Moreover, the challenging question lying ahead 
of us is how genetic and environmental factors translate to molecular disease 
pathways. New approaches, including animal studies and in vitro disease 
modeling, as well as innovative real-world environment assessment methods, will 
help to understand the complex etiology of schizophrenia.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To highlight the most common methods that are used to detect 
new-onset choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as a result of age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD).
RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous modalities are available to try to detect CNV. Amsler 
grid testing, preferential hyperacuity perimetry (PHP), optical coherence 
tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography are tools that may be used to 
detect CNV. The Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Detection of Onset of new 
Choroidal neovascularization Study (AMD DOC Study) evaluated the sensitivity of 
time domain OCT, relative to fluorescein angiography, in detecting new-onset 
neovascular AMD within a 2-year period. The sensitivity of each modality for 
detecting CNV was OCT 0.40 [(95% confidence interval (95% CI) (0.16-0.68), 
supervised Amsler grid 0.42 (95% CI 0.15-0.72), and PHP 0.50 (95% CI 
0.23-0.77)].
SUMMARY: Numerous modalities are available to try to detect CNV. The prospective 
AMD DOC Study demonstrated that fluorescein angiography still remains the best 
method to detect new-onset CNV.

Microarray resources for genetic and genomic studies in chicken: a review.

School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Midlothian, United 
Kingdom.

Advent of microarray technologies revolutionized the nature and scope of genetic 
and genomic research in human and other species by allowing massively parallel 
analysis of thousands of genomic sites. They have been used for diverse purposes 
such as for transcriptome analysis, CNV detection, SNP and CNV genotyping, 
studying DNA-protein interaction, and detection of genome methylation. 
Microarrays have also made invaluable contributions to research in chicken which 
is an important model organism for studying embryology, immunology, oncology, 
virology, evolution, genetics, and genomics and also for other avian species. 
Despite their huge contributions in life science research, the future of 
microarrays is now being questioned with the advent of massively parallel next 
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which promise to overcome some of the 
limitations of microarray platforms. In this article we review the various 
microarray resources developed for chicken and their past and potential future 
applications. We also discuss about the future of microarrays in the NGS era 
particularly in the context of livestock genetics. We argue that even though NGS 
promises some major advantages-in particular, offers the opportunity to discover 
novel elements in the genome-microarrays will continue to be major tools for 
research and practice in the field of livestock genetics/genomics due to their 
affordability, high throughput nature, mature established technologies and ease 
of application. Moreover, with advent of new microarray technologies like 
capture arrays, the NGS and microarrays are expected to complement each other in 
future research in life science.

Copy number variations (CNVs) are gains and losses of genomic sequence between 
two individuals of a species when compared to a reference genome. The data from 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays are now routinely used for 
genotyping, but they also can be utilized for copy number detection. Substantial 
progress has been made in array design and CNV calling algorithms and at least 
10 comparison studies in humans have been published to assess them. In this 
review, we first survey the literature on existing microarray platforms and CNV 
calling algorithms. We then examine a number of CNV calling tools to evaluate 
their impacts using bovine high-density SNP data. Large incongruities in the 
results from different CNV calling tools highlight the need for standardizing 
array data collection, quality assessment and experimental validation. Only 
after careful experimental design and rigorous data filtering can the impacts of 
CNVs on both normal phenotypic variability and disease susceptibility be fully 
revealed.

Current analysis platforms and methods for detecting copy number variation.

Li W(1), Olivier M.

Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.

Copy number variation (CNV), generated through duplication or deletion events 
that affect one or more loci, is widespread in the human genomes and is often 
associated with functional consequences that may include changes in gene 
expression levels or fusion of genes. Genome-wide association studies indicate 
that some disease phenotypes and physiological pathways might be impacted by CNV 
in a small number of characterized genomic regions. However, the pervasiveness 
and full impact of such variation remains unclear. Suitable analytic methods are 
needed to thoroughly mine human genomes for genomic structural variation, and to 
explore the interplay between observed CNV and disease phenotypes, but many 
medical researchers are unfamiliar with the features and nuances of recently 
developed technologies for detecting CNV. In this article, we evaluate a suite 
of commonly used and recently developed approaches to uncovering genome-wide 
CNVs and discuss the relative merits of each.

Copy number variation (CNV) analysis has had a major impact on the field of 
medical genetics, providing a mechanism to identify disease-causing genomic 
alterations in an unprecedented number of diseases and phenotypes. CNV analysis 
is now routinely used in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, and has led to a 
significant increase in the detection of chromosomal abnormalities. These 
findings are used for prenatal decision making, clinical management and genetic 
counseling. Although a powerful tool to identify genomic alterations, CNV 
analysis may also result in the detection of genomic alterations that have 
unknown clinical significance or reveal unintended information. This highlights 
the importance of informed consent and genetic counseling for clinical CNV 
analysis. This review examines the advantages and limitations of CNV discovery 
in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, as well as the impact on the clinician 
and family.

next-generation sequencing.

MOTIVATION: Analysing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for copy number 
variations (CNVs) detection is a relatively new and challenging field, with no 
accepted standard protocols or quality control measures so far. There are by now 
several algorithms developed for each of the four broad methods for CNV 
detection using NGS, namely the depth of coverage (DOC), read-pair, split-read 
and assembly-based methods. However, because of the complexity of the genome and 
the short read lengths from NGS technology, there are still many challenges 
associated with the analysis of NGS data for CNVs, no matter which method or 
algorithm is used.
RESULTS: In this review, we describe and discuss areas of potential biases in 
CNV detection for each of the four methods. In particular, we focus on issues 
pertaining to (i) mappability, (ii) GC-content bias, (iii) quality control 
measures of reads and (iv) difficulty in identifying duplications. To gain 
insights to some of the issues discussed, we also download real data from the 
1000 Genomes Project and analyse its DOC data. We show examples of how reads in 
repeated regions can affect CNV detection, demonstrate current GC-correction 
algorithms, investigate sensitivity of DOC algorithm before and after quality 
control of reads and discuss reasons for which duplications are harder to detect 
than deletions.

Quantum dot enabled molecular sensing and diagnostics.

Zhang Y(1), Wang TH.

Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.

Since its emergence, semiconductor nanoparticles known as quantum dots (QDs) 
have drawn considerable attention and have quickly extended their applicability 
to numerous fields within the life sciences. This is largely due to their unique 
optical properties such as high brightness and narrow emission band as well as 
other advantages over traditional organic fluorophores. New molecular sensing 
strategies based on QDs have been developed in pursuit of high sensitivity, high 
throughput, and multiplexing capabilities. For traditional biological 
applications, QDs have already begun to replace traditional organic fluorophores 
to serve as simple fluorescent reporters in immunoassays, microarrays, 
fluorescent imaging applications, and other assay platforms. In addition, 
smarter, more advanced QD probes such as quantum dot fluorescence resonance 
energy transfer (QD-FRET) sensors, quenching sensors, and barcoding systems are 
paving the way for highly-sensitive genetic and epigenetic detection of 
diseases, multiplexed identification of infectious pathogens, and tracking of 
intracellular drug and gene delivery. When combined with microfluidics and 
confocal fluorescence spectroscopy, the detection limit is further enhanced to 
single molecule level. Recently, investigations have revealed that QDs 
participate in series of new phenomena and exhibit interesting 
non-photoluminescent properties. Some of these new findings are now being 
incorporated into novel assays for gene copy number variation (CNV) studies and 
DNA methylation analysis with improved quantification resolution. Herein, we 
provide a comprehensive review on the latest developments of QD based molecular 
diagnostic platforms in which QD plays a versatile and essential role.

Common neurodevelopmental disorders (including autism, speech and language 
delay, schizophrenia, epilepsy and intellectual disability) have complex 
aetiology, which is predominantly genomic, but also environmental in origin. 
They share a paradox, in that high heritability is matched by lowered fecundity, 
placing them under negative genetic selection. This implicates variants of 
recent origin, such as de novo mutations or common, very low-risk polymorphisms 
that escape negative selection. High or moderate risk variants have been 
discovered by chromosome analysis, genome sequencing and copy number variant 
(CNV) detection, including a 3Mb deletion causing 22q11.2 deletion syndrome 
(Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome) that has penetrance of up to 50% for 
schizophrenia. More recently, rare, recurrent and often de novo pathogenic CNVs, 
including deletions at NRXN1, 1q21.2, 15q11.2 and 15q13.3, 16p11.2 and 
duplications at VIPR2 and 16p13.11, have also been discovered. These have 
several unique features that differentiate them from Mendelian disease mutations 
in that they have incomplete penetrance, with moderate-to-high odds ratios for 
risk, and show diagnostic pleiotropy, increasing risk across the 
neurodevelopmental disorder spectrum. Some are also syndromic, with 
characteristic features such as facial dysmorphology, and other specific risks 
such as aortic dissection or obesity, implying that they might be better 
classified as distinct diagnoses. The discovery of pathogenic CNVs provide new 
opportunities for translation leading to patent benefit, including improvements 
in clinical genetic diagnosis and genetic counselling, the possibility of 
clinician decision-making tools for risk prediction, and the identification of 
drug targets and implementation of personalised medicine using stratification by 
genotype.

Maze Pond, SE1 9RT, London, UK.

Copy number variation (CNV) might be one of the main contributors to phenotypic 
diversity and evolutionary adaptation in animals and plants, employing a wide 
variety of mechanisms, such as gene dosage and transcript structure alterations, 
to modulate organismal plasticity. In the past 4 years, considerable advances 
have been made in the characterization of the genomic architecture of CNV in 
domestic species. First, low-resolution CNV maps were produced for cattle, goat, 
sheep, pig, dog, chicken, duck and turkey, showing that these structural 
polymorphisms comprise a significant part of these genomes. Furthermore, CNVs 
have been associated with several pigmentation (white coat in horse, pig and 
sheep) and morphological (late feathering and pea comb in chicken) traits, as 
well as with susceptibility to a wide array of diseases and developmental 
disorders, for example osteopetrosis, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, copper 
toxicosis, intersexuality, cone degeneration, periodic fever and dermoid sinus, 
among others. In the future, development of high-resolution tools for CNV 
detection and typing combined with the implementation of databases integrating 
CNV, QTL and gene expression data will be essential to identify and measure the 
impact of this source of structural variation on the many phenotypes that are 
relevant to animal breeders and veterinary practitioners.

Role of copy number variants in structural birth defects.

Southard AE(1), Edelmann LJ, Gelb BD.

Author information:

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Human genomes include copy number variants (CNVs), 
defined as regions with DNA gains or losses. Pathologic CNVs, which are larger 
and often occur de novo, are increasingly associated with disease. Given 
advances in genetic testing, namely microarray-based comparative genomic 
hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, previously unidentified 
genotypic aberrations can now be correlated with phenotypic anomalies. The 
objective of this study was to conduct a nonsystematic literature review to 
document the role of CNVs as they relate to isolated structural anomalies of the 
craniofacial, respiratory, renal, and cardiac systems.
METHODS: All full-length articles in the PubMed database through May 2011 that 
discussed CNVs and isolated structural defects of the craniofacial, respiratory, 
renal, and cardiac systems were considered. Search terms queried include CNV, 
copy number variation, array comparative genomic hybridization, birth defects, 
craniofacial defects, respiratory defects, renal defects, and congenital heart 
disease. Reports published in languages other than English and articles 
regarding CNVs and neurocognitive deficits were not considered.
RESULTS: Evidence supports that putatively pathogenic CNVs occur at an increased 
frequency in patients with isolated structural birth defects and implicate 
specific regions of the genome. Through CNV detection, advances have been made 
in identifying genes and specific loci that underlie isolated birth defects.
CONCLUSIONS: Although limited studies have been published, the promising 
evidence reviewed here warrants the continued investigation of CNVs in children 
with isolated structural birth defects. Patient care and genetic counseling 
stand to improve through a better understanding of CNVs and their effect on 
disease phenotype.

Higher resolution whole-genome arrays facilitate the identification of smaller 
copy number variations (CNVs) and their integral genes contributing to autism 
and/or intellectual disability (ASD/ID). Our study describes the use of one of 
the highest resolution arrays, the Affymetrix(®) Cytogenetics 2.7M array, 
coupled with quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of short 
fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) for detection and validation of small CNVs. We 
studied 82 subjects with ASD and ID in total (30 in the validation and 52 in the 
application cohort) and detected putatively pathogenic CNVs in 6/52 cases from 
the application cohort. This included a 130-kb maternal duplication spanning 
exons 64-79 of the DMD gene which was found in a 3-year-old boy manifesting 
autism and mild neuromotor delays. Other pathogenic CNVs involved 4p14, 
12q24.31, 14q32.31, 15q13.2-13.3, and 17p13.3. We established the optimal 
experimental conditions which, when applied to select small CNVs for QMPSF 
confirmation, reduced the false positive rate from 60% to 25%. Our work suggests 
that selection of small CNVs based on the function of integral genes, followed 
by review of array experimental parameters resulting in highest confirmation 
rate using multiplex PCR, may enhance the usefulness of higher resolution 
platforms for ASD and ID gene discovery.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) is now widely adopted as a 
first-tier clinical diagnostic test in individuals with unexplained 
developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) and congenital anomalies. 
Our study aimed at enlarging the phenotypic spectrum associated with clinically 
relevant copy number variants (CNVs) as well as delineating clinical criteria, 
which may help separating patients with pathogenic CNVs from those without 
pathogenic CNVs. We performed a retrospective review of clinical and array CGH 
data of 342 children with unexplained DD/ID. The phenotypic features of patients 
with clinically significant CNV were compared with those without pathogenic 
CNVs. Array CGH detected pathogenic CNVs in 13.2% of the patients. Congenital 
anomalies, especially heart defects, as well as primary microcephaly, short 
stature and failure to thrive were clearly more frequent in children with 
pathogenic CNVs compared with children with normal array CGH results. Thus, we 
assume that in patients with unexplained DD/ID, array CGH will more probably 
detect a significant CNV if any of these features is part of the patient's 
phenotype.

Detection and characterization of copy number variation in autism spectrum 
disorder.

Canada.

There now exist multiple lines of evidence pointing to a significant genetic 
component underlying the aetiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The 
advent of methodologies for scanning the human genome at high resolution, 
coupled with the recognition of copy number variation (CNV) as a prevalent 
source of genomic variation, has led to new strategies in the identification of 
clinically relevant loci. Balanced genomic changes, such as translocations and 
inversions, also contribute to ASD, but current studies have shown that 
screening with microarrays has up to fivefold increase in diagnostic yield. 
Recent work by our group and others has shown unbalanced genomic alterations 
that are likely pathogenic in upwards of 10% of cases, highlighting an important 
role for CNVs in the genetic aetiology of ASD. A trend in our empirical data has 
shifted focus for discovery of candidate loci towards individually rare but 
highly penetrant CNVs instead of looking for common variants of low penetrance. 
This strategy has proven largely successful in identifying ASD-susceptibility 
candidate loci, including gains and losses at 16p11.2, SHANK2, NRXN1, and 
PTCHD1. Another emerging and intriguing trend is the identification of the same 
genes implicated by rare CNVs across neurodevelopmental disorders, including 
schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual 
disability. These observations indicate that similar pathways may be involved in 
phenotypically distinct outcomes. Although interrogation of the genome at high 
resolution has led to these novel discoveries, it has also made cataloguing, 
characterization, and clinical interpretation of the increasing amount of CNV 
data difficult. Herein, we describe the history of genomic structural variation 
in ASD and how CNV discovery has been used to pinpoint novel ASD-susceptibility 
loci. We also discuss the overlap of CNVs across neurodevelopmental disorders 
and comment on the current challenges of understanding the relationship between 
CNVs and associated phenotypes in a clinical context.

[Autism spectrum disorder and genes for synaptic proteins].

Sciences, Japan.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impaired social interaction 
and communication, and restricted interests. It is generally accepted that ASD 
is caused by abnormalities in the structure or functions of the brain. Recent 
genome-wide analyses have identified copy number variations (CNVs) of neuronal 
genes in the genomes of ASD patients. CNV is a commonly observed phenomenon in 
human beings. During the first cell division of meiosis, irregular crossing over 
between homologous chromosomes results in loss or duplication of a segment. From 
2007 to 2010, several groups performed a large-scale virtual screening of CNVs 
in ASD genomes. Genes affected by CNV, de novo CNVs, and rare CNVs were more 
prevalent in ASD. The results highlighted the CNVs of many neuronal genes 
associated with ASD. A fraction of these genes was previously identified in ASD 
but some were newly identified in each study. The CNVs implicated in ASD include 
neuronal genes belonging to 4 classes. These genes encode (1) neural adhesion 
molecules, including cadherins, neuroligin, and neurexin; (2) scaffold proteins 
such as SHANK3; (3) protein kinases and other intracellular signaling molecules; 
and (4) proteins that regulate protein syntheses. In general, these proteins 
play a role in synapse of glutamatergic neurons. The CNVs detected in the ASD 
patient genomes of imply a link between the synaptic proteins and pathological 
characteristics of ASD. Altered protein dosage by the CNVs may alter the 
functional quality of ASD patient's synapses, and may consequently affect their 
development of language and communication skills. There are 2 types of ASD, one 
is sporadic and, the other is familial. According to some reports, de novo CNVs 
are more frequently observed in sporadic-type ASD. However, it is generally 
understood that a combination of particular CNVs and other possible mutations 
underlie the pathology of ASD regardless of ASD type. The major symptoms of ASD 
are often curable with behavioral intervention during early childhood. An early 
diagnosis, followed by early start of treatment is crucial for language 
development and communication skills. Further and broader research on genomes 
will eventually provide information on the biological characteristics of ASD, as 
well as on specific ASD genotypes, thus aiding in the establishment of optimal 
treatment and medication to meet the biological conditions of each patient.

MOTIVATION: The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies is 
revolutionizing our ability in discovering and genotyping DNA copy number 
variants (CNVs). Read count-based approaches are able to detect CNV regions with 
an unprecedented resolution. Although this computational strategy has been 
recently introduced in literature, much work has been already done for the 
preparation, normalization and analysis of this kind of data.
RESULTS: Here we face the many aspects that cover the detection of CNVs by using 
read count approach. We first study the characteristics and systematic biases of 
read count distributions, focusing on the normalization methods designed for 
removing these biases. Subsequently, we compare the algorithms designed to 
detect the boundaries of CNVs and we investigate the ability of read count data 
to predict the exact number of DNA copy. Finally, we review the tools publicly 
available for analysing read count data. To better understand the state of the 
art of read count approaches, we compare the performance of the three most 
widely used sequencing technologies (Illumina Genome Analyzer, Roche 454 and 
Life Technologies SOLiD) in all the analyses that we perform.

Analyses of structural genome variation by array-CGH have dramatically enhanced 
our ability to detect copy number variations (CNVs). De novo CNVs and those 
co-segregating with disease in a family are generally interpreted as pathogenic. 
Yet, often CNVs, such as recurrent microdeletions in region 15q13.3, are not so 
clearly pathogenic. Here we discuss potential confounding mechanisms that may 
lead to the phenotypic pleiotropy of CNVs, such as unmasking of recessive 
alleles by hemizygous deletions, interaction of CNVs with other loci and genes, 
genetic epistasis, allelic exclusion, and somatic mosaicism. We illustrate some 
of these mechanisms with a detailed analysis of recent studies of CNVs involving 
MCPH1, AUTS2, CNTNAP2, and mutations in GRIN2B. Next we discuss the clinical 
ramifications of these findings and urge workers to avoid 'diagnostic fatalism' 
(i.e., halting all genetic investigation after the detection of a single CNV) 
and address some of the future challenges likely to result from implementations 
of next generation sequencing techniques.

Genome arrays for the detection of copy number variations in idiopathic mental 
retardation, idiopathic generalized epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders: 
lessons for diagnostic workflow and research.

We review the contributions and limitations of genome-wide array-based 
identification of copy number variants (CNVs) in the clinical diagnostic 
evaluation of patients with mental retardation (MR) and other brain-related 
disorders. In unselected MR referrals a causative genomic gain or loss is 
detected in 14-18% of cases. Usually, such CNVs arise de novo, are not found in 
healthy subjects, and have a major impact on the phenotype by altering the 
dosage of multiple genes. This high diagnostic yield justifies array-based 
segmental aneuploidy screening as the initial genetic test in these patients. 
This also pertains to patients with autism (expected yield about 5-10% in 
nonsyndromic and 10-20% in syndromic patients) and schizophrenia (at least 5% 
yield). CNV studies in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder and Tourette syndrome indicate 
that patients have, on average, a larger CNV burden as compared to controls. 
Collectively, the CNV studies suggest that a wide spectrum of 
disease-susceptibility variants exists, most of which are rare (<0.1%) and of 
variable and usually small effect. Notwithstanding, a rare CNV can have a major 
impact on the phenotype. Exome sequencing in MR and autism patients revealed de 
novo mutations in protein coding genes in 60 and 20% of cases, respectively. 
Therefore, it is likely that arrays will be supplanted by next-generation 
sequencing methods as the initial and perhaps ultimate diagnostic tool in 
patients with brain-related disorders, revealing both CNVs and mutations in a 
single test.

Inter-individual genomic variations have recently become evident with advances 
in sequencing techniques and genome-wide array comparative genomic 
hybridization. Among such variations single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are 
widely studied and better defined because of availability of large-scale 
detection platforms. However, insertion-deletions, inversions, copy-number 
variations (CNVs) also populate our genomes. The large structural variations 
(>3 Mb) have been known for past 20 years, however, their link to health and 
disease remain ill-defined. CNVs are defined as the segment of DNA >1 kb in 
size, and compared with reference genome vary in its copy number. All these 
types of genomic variations are bound to have vital role in disease 
susceptibility and drug response. In this review, the discussion is confined to 
CNVs and their link to health, diseases and drug response. There are several 
CNVs reported till date, which have important roles in an individual's 
susceptibility to several complex and common disorders. This review compiles 
some of these CNVs and analyzes their involvement in diseases in different 
populations, analyses available evidence and rationalizes their involvement in 
the development of disease phenotype. Combined with SNP, additional genomic 
variations including CNV, will provide better correlations between individual 
genomic variations and health.

Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has led to an increased detection 
of causal chromosomal imbalances in individuals with congenital heart defects 
(CHD). The introduction of aCGH as a diagnostic tool in a clinical cardiogenetic 
setting entails numerous challenges. Based on our own experience as well as 
those of others described in the literature, we outline the state of the art and 
attempt to answer a number of outstanding questions such as the detection 
frequency of causal imbalances in different patient populations, the added value 
of higher-resolution arrays, and the existence of predictive factors in 
syndromic cases. We introduce a step-by-step approach for clinical 
interpretation of copy number variants (CNV) detected in CHD, which is primarily 
based on gene content and overlap with known chromosomal syndromes, rather than 
on CNV inheritance and size. Based on this algorithm, we have reclassified the 
detected aberrations in aCGH studies for their causality for syndromic and 
non-syndromic CHD. From this literature overview, supplemented with own 
investigations in a cohort of 46 sporadic patients with severe non-syndromic 
CHD, it seems clear that the frequency of causal CNVs in non-syndromic CHD 
populations is lower than that in syndromic CNV populations (3.6 vs. 19%). 
Moreover, causal CNVs in non-syndromic CHD mostly involve imbalances with a 
moderate effect size and reduced penetrance, whereas the majority of causal 
imbalances in syndromic CHD consistently affects human development and 
significantly reduces reproductive fitness.

In Western countries, therapeutic management of patients affected by choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) secondary to different typologies of macular 
degeneration represents a major health care problem. Age-related macular 
degeneration is the disease most frequently associated with CNV development. 
Schematically, CNVs can be distinguished into classic and occult subtypes, which 
are characterized by variable natural history and different responsiveness to 
some therapeutic procedures. At present, the dramatic vision loss due to CNV can 
be mainly treated by two interventional strategies, which are utilizable in 
either single or combined modalities: photodynamic therapy with verteporfin 
(PDT-V), and intravitreal administration of drugs acting against vascular 
endothelial growth factor. The combined use of PDT-V and anti-angiogenic drugs 
represents one of the most promising strategies against neovascular macular 
degeneration, but it unavoidably results in an expensive increase in health 
resource utilization. However, the positive data from several studies serve as a 
basis for reconsidering the role of PDT-V, which has undergone a renaissance 
prompted by the need for a more rational therapeutic approach toward CNV. New 
pharmacogenetic knowledge of PDT-V points to exploratory prospects to optimize 
the clinical application of this intriguing photothrombotic procedure. In fact, 
a Medline search provides data regarding the role of several single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic predictors of CNV responsiveness to PDT-V. 
Specifically, correlations between SNPs and different levels of PDT-V efficacy 
have been detected by examining the gene variants influencing (i) 
thrombo-coagulative pathways, i.e. methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 
677C>T (rs1801133), factor V (F5) 1691G>A (rs6025), prothrombin (F2) 20210G>A 
(rs1799963), and factor XIII-A (F13A1) 185G>T (rs5985); (ii) complement 
activation and/or inflammatory processes, i.e. complement factor H (CFH) 1277T>C 
(rs1061170), high-temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1) promoter -512G>A 
(rs11200638), and two variants of the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene (rs2808635 
and rs876538); and (iii) production and bioavailability of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGFA -2578C>A [rs699947] and rs2146323). This article critically 
evaluates both the clinical plausibility and the opportunity to utilize the most 
important SNP-response interactions of PDT-V for an effective upgrade of the 
current anti-CNV therapeutic scenario. In addition, the pharmacogenetics of a 
very severe post-PDT-V adverse event, i.e. a decrease in acute vision, is 
briefly discussed. A comprehensive appraisal of the findings reviewed in this 
article should be carefully considered to design future trials aimed at 
verifying (after proper genotypic stratification of the enrolled patients) 
whether these innovative pharmacogenetic approaches will be able to improve the 
multifaceted interventional management of neovascular macular degeneration.

Diagnostic tools for macular disease have developped over the last years due 
both to the elaboration of new methods of approach and to the improvement of the 
already existing ones. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a minimally invasive 
procedure that involves photographic surveillance of the blood circulation of 
the retina and choroid, thus offering data on fundus pathology In eyes with AMD 
(Age Related Macular Degeneration) the assessment through FA is necessary in 
order to confirm the presence of CNV (Choroidal Neovascular Membrane). Beside 
that, FA offers details about the size, location and type (occult or classic) of 
CNV and it is useful in the followup after treatment. OCT (Optical Coherence 
Tomography) is a modern imagistic method, that is non-invasive, easily repetable 
and lacks complications. It acquires in vivo images that represent 
cross-sections of the retina. In the last years it has become an ever more 
popular diagnostic tool. OCT imaging is able to detect the presence of CNV and 
of sub- and intraretinal fluid accumulation. During the last decade, the 
management of neovascular AMD has changed, as anti-VEGF therapy has become the 
treatment of choice for all subfoveal CNV lesions types (occult and classic). 
Some clinicians tend to overlook the importance of FA assessment and rely only 
on visual acuity and OCT imaging for establishing both diagnosis and indication 
of treatment. Experts in the field say that these two investigations provide 
complementary information. They agree that the anatomical data offered by OCT 
imaging should be supported by the proof that an active exudation exists, which 
can only be provided by FA. At this moment the management of AMD includes both 
FA and OCT scanning. Several studies have tried to determine which OCT 
parameters corelate best with the activity of CNV as it appears on FA 
photographs. Further on, we shall present a few clinical cases that we consider 
representative for the topic.

Array-based methods have enabled the detection of many genomic gains and losses. 
These are stated as copy number variants (CNVs) and comprise up to 13% of the 
human genome. Based on their breakpoints and modes of formation CNVs are termed 
recurrent or nonrecurrent. Recurrent CNVs are flanked by low copy repeats and 
are of a fixed size. They arise as a result of misalignment during meiosis by a 
mechanism named nonallelic homologous recombination. Several of such recurrent 
CNVs have been linked to human diseases. Nonrecurrent CNVs, which are not 
flanked by low copy repeats, are of variable size and may arise via mechanisms 
like nonhomologous end joining and replication-based mechanisms described by the 
fork stalling and template switching and microhomology-mediated break-induced 
replication models. It is becoming clear that most disease-causing CNVs are 
nonrecurrent and generally arise via replication-based mechanisms. Furthermore, 
it is now appreciated that genomic features other than low copy repeats play a 
role in the formation of nonrecurrent CNVs. This review will discuss the 
different mechanisms of CNV formation and how high resolution analyses of CNV 
breakpoints have added to our knowledge of their precise structure.

Copy number and SNP arrays in clinical diagnostics.

Houston, Texas 77030, USA.

The ability of chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) to detect submicroscopic 
genetic abnormalities has revolutionized the clinical diagnostic approach to 
individuals with intellectual disability, neurobehavioral phenotypes, and 
congenital malformations. The recognition of the underlying copy number variant 
(CNV) in respective individuals may allow not only for better counseling and 
anticipatory guidance but also for more specific therapeutic interventions in 
some cases. The use of CMA technology in prenatal diagnosis is emerging and 
promises higher sensitivity for several highly penetrant, clinically severe 
microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Genetic counseling complements the 
diagnostic testing with CMA, given the presence of CNVs of uncertain clinical 
significance, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity in some cases. 
While oligonucleotide arrays with high-density exonic coverage remain the gold 
standard for the detection of CNVs, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays 
allow for detection of consanguinity and most cases of uniparental disomy and 
provide a higher sensitivity to detect low-level mosaic aneuploidies.

BACKGROUND: Since 2008, multiple studies have reported on copy number variations 
(CNVs) in schizophrenia. However, many regions are unique events with minimal 
overlap between studies. This makes it difficult to gain a comprehensive 
overview of all CNVs involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. We performed a 
systematic CNV study on the basis of a homogeneous genome-wide dataset aiming at 
all CNVs ≥ 50 kilobase pair. We complemented this analysis with a review of 
cytogenetic and chromosomal abnormalities for schizophrenia reported in the 
literature with the purpose of combining classical genetic findings and our 
current understanding of genomic variation.
METHODS: We investigated 834 Dutch schizophrenia patients and 672 Dutch control 
subjects. The CNVs were included if they were detected by QuantiSNP 
(http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/QuantiSNP/) as well as PennCNV 
(http://www.neurogenome.org/cnv/penncnv/) and contain known protein coding 
genes. The integrated identification of CNV regions and cytogenetic loci 
indicates regions of interest (cytogenetic regions of interest [CROIs]).
RESULTS: In total, 2437 CNVs were identified with an average number of 2.1 
CNVs/subject for both cases and control subjects. We observed significantly more 
deletions but not duplications in schizophrenia cases versus control subjects. 
The CNVs identified coincide with loci previously reported in the literature, 
confirming well-established schizophrenia CROIs 1q42 and 22q11.2 as well as 
indicating a potentially novel CROI on chromosome 5q35.1.
CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal deletions are more prevalent in schizophrenia patients 
than in healthy subjects and therefore confer a risk factor for pathogenicity. 
The combination of our CNV data with previously reported cytogenetic 
abnormalities in schizophrenia provides an overview of potentially interesting 
regions for positional candidate genes.

Subchromosomal abnormalities can be positioned by the detection of copy number 
variation (CNV) using microarray comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). aCGH 
has become a powerful tool in understanding the association between gene and 
genetic etiology in both research and clinical laboratories. Meanwhile as a new 
technique, controversies inevitably arose in its clinical application. As for 
the phenotype of CNV, little has been disclosed. For the clinicians, the 
difficulty in explanation of the CNV to the patients is obvious, which makes 
many doctors refuse to use aCGH for clinical diagnosis. Customized arrays have 
been exploited to decrease the uncertainty and efforts to search for a balance 
between overloaded information and insufficient information have been made. The 
purpose of this review is to discuss the current limitations and difficulties in 
application of aCGH in prenatal diagnosis and its application prospect from the 
point of a clinician.

Genetic contribution to common epilepsies.

Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review key findings over the past year in the genetics of 
the common epilepsies and consider their impact on the field.
RECENT FINDINGS: There have been important discoveries across two major aspects 
of genetics of the common epilepsies. Firstly, the first genome-wide association 
study in epilepsy has been published, for the focal epilepsies. With reasonable 
power to detect even modest effect sizes, the absence of genome-wide significant 
association demands refinement of further single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP)-based genome-wide approaches, with a focus on more homogeneous phenotypes. 
Secondly, several putatively causal variants of a different type, copy number 
variants (CNVs), have been discovered. Several recurrent epilepsy-associated 
CNVs have been identified, including microdeletions at 15q13.3 and 16p13.11. 
CNVs constitute the commonest known genetic cause of the epilepsies. How CNVs 
cause disease, and why the same CNV can cause different diseases is unexplained. 
Nevertheless, CNVs will accelerate discovery of 'epilepsy genes', focussing 
attention on specific genomic regions. With the published genome-wide SNP study, 
CNVs are redirecting research efforts to a search for rare variants underlying 
common epilepsies. CNVs have also highlighted the challenges ahead in 
genotype-phenotype correlation.
SUMMARY: Major discoveries are reshaping the genetics of the common epilepsies 
and prefiguring whole exome/whole genome resequencing efforts.

Copy number variants (CNVs) create a major source of variation among individuals 
and populations. Array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) is a 
powerful method used to detect and compare the copy numbers of DNA sequences at 
high resolution along the genome. In recent years, several informatics tools for 
accurate and efficient CNV detection and assessment have been developed. In this 
paper, most of the well known algorithms, analysis software and the limitations 
of that software will be briefly reviewed.

Antivascular endothelial growth factor for choroidal neovascularization in 
pathologic myopia.

Battaglia Parodi M, Iacono P, Bandello F.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the most common vision-threatening macular 
complication in pathologic myopia (PM) being detectable in 4-11% of the affected 
eyes. Treatment of PM-related CNV is still controversial. Intravitreal 
injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor molecules are able to 
inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor isoforms and have shown promise 
in the treatment of myopic CNV. The present review describes the beneficial 
effects of this approach both for subfoveal and juxtafoveal CNV. However, 
considering the lack of randomized clinical trials and the relatively short 
follow-up in most of the studies, a multicentric clinical trial should be 
necessary to validate the positive results in the long term.

The completion of Human Genome Project and the "HapMap" project was followed by 
translational activities from companies within the private sector. This led to 
the introduction of genome-wide scans based on hundreds of thousands of single 
nucleotide polymorphysms (SNP). These scans were based on common genetic 
variants in human populations. This new and powerful technology was then applied 
to the existing DNA-based datasets with information on psychiatric disorders. As 
a result, an unprecedented amount of novel scientific insights related to the 
underlying biology and genetics of psychiatric disorders was obtained. The 
dominant design of these studies, so called "genome-wide association studies" 
(GWAS), used statistical methods which minimized the risk of false positive 
reports and provided much greater power to detect genotype-phenotype 
associations. All findings were entirely data-driven rather than 
hypothesis-driven, which often made it difficult for researchers to understand 
or interpret the findings. Interestingly, this work in genetics is indicating 
how non-specific some genes are for psychiatric disorders, having associations 
in common for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. This suggests that the 
earlier stages of psychiatric disorders may be multi-valent and that early 
detection, coupled with a clearer understanding of the environmental factors, 
may allow prevention. At the present time, the rich "harvest" from GWAS still 
has very limited power to predict the variation in psychiatric disease status at 
individual level, typically explaining less than 5% of the total risk variance. 
The most recent studies of common genetic variation implicated the role of major 
histocompatibility complex in schizophrenia and other disorders. They also 
provided molecular evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of 
psychiatric diseases, involving thousands of common alleles of very small 
effect. The studies of structural genetic variation, such as copy number 
variants (CNV), coupled with the efforts targeting rare genetic variation (using 
the emerging whole-genome "deep" sequencing technologies) will become the area 
of the greatest interest in the field of genetic epidemiology. This will be 
complemented by the studies of epigenetic phoenomena, changes of expression at a 
large scale and understanding gene-gene interactions in complex networks using 
systems biology approaches. A deeper understanding of the underlying biology of 
psychiatric disorders is essential to improve diagnoses and therapies of these 
diseases. New technologies - genome-wide association studies, imaging and the 
optical manipulation of neural circuits - are promising to provide novel 
insights and lead to new treatments.

The field of human genetic variations has progressed rapidly over the past few 
years. It has added much information and deepened our knowledge and 
understanding of the diversity of genetic variations in the human genome. This 
significant progress has been driven mainly by the developments of microarray 
and next generation sequencing technologies. The array-based methods have been 
widely used for large-scale copy number variation (CNV) detection in the human 
genome. The arrival of next generation sequencing technologies, which enabled 
the completion of several whole genome resequencing studies, has also resulted 
in a massive discovery of genetic variations. These studies have identified 
several hundred thousand short indels and a total of thousands of CNVs and other 
structural variations in the human genome. The discovery of these 'newer' types 
of genetic variations, indels, CNVs and copy neutral variations (inversions and 
translocations) has also widened the scope of genetic markers in human genetic 
and disease gene mapping studies. The aim of this review article is to summarize 
the latest developments in the discovery of human genetic variations and address 
the issue of inadequate coverage of genetic variations in the current 
genome-wide association studies, which mainly focuses on common SNPs. Finally, 
we also discuss the future directions in the field and their impacts on next 
generation genome-wide association studies.

Cytogenetic studies have demonstrated that duplications or deletions of entire 
chromosomes or microscopically visible aberrations are associated with specific 
congenital disorders. The subsequent development and application of 
microarray-based assays have established the importance of copy number variants 
(CNV) as a substantial source of genetic diversity in the human genome. 
Pathogenic CNVs are associated not only with birth defects and cancers, but also 
with neurodevelopmental disorders at birth or neurodegenerative diseases in 
adulthood. Unfortunately, the limited knowledge of the phenotypic effects of 
most CNVs has led to the classification of many CNVs as genomic imbalances of 
unknown clinical significance. This has caused many clinicians to resist the 
introduction of microarray technologies in detecting CNVs in a genome-wide 
manner for prenatal applications. This review summarises our current 
understanding of CNVs, the common detection methods, and the implications for 
human health and prenatal diagnosis.

Copy-number variation (CNV) is the most prevalent type of structural variation 
in the human genome. There is emerging evidence that copy-number variants (CNVs) 
provide a new vista on understanding susceptibility to neuropsychiatric 
disorders. Some challenges in the interpretation of current CNV studies include 
the use of overlapping samples, differing phenotypic definitions, an absence of 
population norms for CNVs and a lack of consensus in methods for CNV detection 
and analysis. Here, we review current CNV association study methods and results 
in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia, and provide suggestions 
for design approaches to future studies that might maximize the translation of 
this work to etiological understanding.

Autism and related traits are highly heritable but cannot be explained by 
currently known genetic risk factors. Therefore, the advent of genome-wide 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variant (CNV) microarray 
technologies heralded identification of additional autism loci. CNVs associated 
with autism seem to show variable expressivity, also leading to other 
phenotypes, such as schizophrenia, mental retardation/developmental delay and 
epilepsy. Initial genome-wide SNP-association studies have each identified a 
single novel associated locus with modest effect. Based on the lessons from 
other complex common disease, larger sample sizes and meta-analyses are likely 
to identify additional SNP loci, and the genes implicated may act on multiple 
related disorders. Even if common alleles or rare variants hold little 
predictive value, neurodevelopmental pathways disrupted in autism may be 
identified. Future research might yet uncover common CNV risk loci and rare 
single nucleotide risk alleles, which are currently difficult to detect. The 
genetic architecture and phenotypic heterogeneity identified so far suggest 
additional approaches, such as population-based research and study of relevant 
neurobiological endophenotypes.

Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disease with strong evidence of genetic 
risk factors. Recent studies based on genome-wide study of copy number 
variations (CNVs) have detected novel recurrent submicroscopic copy number 
changes, including recurrent deletions at 1q21.11, 15q11.3, 15q13.3, and the 
recurrent CNV at the 2p16.3 neurexin 1 locus. These schizophrenia susceptibility 
CNV loci demonstrate that schizophrenia is, at least in part, genetic in origin 
and provide the basis for further investigation of mutations associated with the 
disease. The studies combined have also established the role of rare and-in 
sporadic cases-de novo variants in schizophrenia. Furthermore, neuronal-related 
genes and genetic pathways are starting to emerge from the CNV loci associated 
with schizophrenia. Here, we review the major findings in the recent literature, 
which begin to unravel the genetic and biological architecture of this complex 
human neuropsychiatric disorder.

Data from whole genome association studies can now be used for dual purposes, 
genotyping and copy number detection. In this review we discuss some of the 
methods for using SNP data to detect copy number events. We examine a number of 
algorithms designed to detect copy number changes through the use of 
signal-intensity data and consider methods to evaluate the changes found. We 
describe the use of several statistical models in copy number detection in 
germline samples. We also present a comparison of data using these methods to 
assess accuracy of prediction and detection of changes in copy number.

BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) in eye disease was approved 10 years ago 
for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Thereafter it was approved for 
choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in pathological myopia. The treatment regimen 
is based on two prospective, multicentre trials (TAP and VIP studies).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the meantime PDT has been successfully used also in 
several other ocular diseases. PDT is minimally invasive and has an excellent 
side effect profile. Different diseases and their treatment with PDT are 
discussed.
RESULTS: The treatments of idiopathic CNV, secondary CNV in inflammatory 
diseases of the retina and choroid, choroidal haemangioma, vasoproliferative 
tumours, malignant melanoma of the choroid, and central serous chorioretinopathy 
with PDT are described. In most patients the disease progression can be stopped 
and in some the PDT treatment results in visual improvement. The prognosis is 
better in patients with early disease detection and small lesions.
CONCLUSION: Several retinal and choroidal diseases can be treated successfully 
with PDT. Except for AMD and pathological myopia, PDT is an off label treatment.

Copy number variants (CNVs) in primate species using array-based comparative 
genomic hybridization.

A substantial amount of genomic variation is now known to exist in humans and 
other primate species. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are thought to 
represent the vast majority of genomic differences among individuals in a given 
primate species and comprise about 0.1% of the genomes of two humans. However, 
recent studies have now shown that structural variation msay account for as much 
as 0.7% of the genomic differences in humans, of which copy number variants 
(CNVs) are the largest component. CNVs are segments of DNA that can range in 
size from hundreds of bases to millions of base pairs in length and have 
different number of copies between individuals. Recent technological 
advancements in array technologies led to genome-wide identification of CNVs and 
consequently revealed thousands of variable loci in humans, comprising as much 
as 12% of the human genome [A.J. Iafrate, L. Feuk, M.N. Rivera, M.L. Listewnik, 
P.K. Donahoe, Y. Qi, S.W. Scherer, C. Lee, Nat. Genet. 36 (2004) 949-951, [3]]. 
CNVs in humans have already been associated with susceptibility to certain 
complex diseases, dietary adaptation, and several neurological conditions. In 
addition, recent studies have shown that CNVs can be successfully implemented in 
population genetics research, providing important insights into human genetic 
variation. Nevertheless, the important role of CNVs in primate evolution and 
genetic diversity is still largely unknown. This article aims to outline the 
strengths and weaknesses of current comparative genomic hybridization array 
technologies that have been employed to detect CNV variation and the 
applications of these techniques to primate genetic research.

Substantial progress in malaria genomics and genotyping has been made recently, 
particularly the development of various microarray platforms for large-scale 
characterization of the Plasmodium falciparum genome. Microarray has been used 
for gene expression analysis, detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
and copy number variation (CNV), characterization of chromatin modifications, 
and other applications. Here we discuss some recent advances in genetic mapping 
and genomic studies of malaria parasites, focusing on the use of high-throughput 
arrays for the detection of SNP and CNV in the P. falciparum genome. Strategies 
for genetic mapping of malaria traits are also discussed.

BACKGROUND: International databases with information on copy number variation of 
the human genome are an important reference for laboratories using high 
resolution whole genome screening. Genomic deletions or duplications which have 
been detected in the healthy population and thus marked as normal copy number 
variants (CNVs) can be filtered out using these databases when searching for 
pathogenic copy number changes in patients. However, a potential pitfall of this 
strategy is that reported normal CNVs often do not elicit further investigation, 
and thus may remain unrecognised when they are present in a (pathogenic) 
homozygous state. The impact on disease of CNVs in the homozygous state may thus 
remain undetected and underestimated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a patient with syndromic hearing loss, array comparative 
genomic hybridisation (array CGH) and multiple ligation dependent probe 
amplification (MLPA) revealed a homozygous deletion on 15q15.3 of a CNV, 
inherited from hemizygous carrier parents. The deletion is about 90 kilobases 
and contains four genes including the STRC gene, which is involved in autosomal 
recessive deafness (DFNB16). By screening healthy control individuals and review 
of publicly available CNV data we estimated the frequency of hemizygous deletion 
carriers to be about 1.6%.
CONCLUSION: We characterised a homozygous deletion of a CNV region causing 
syndromic hearing loss by a panel of molecular tools. Together with the 
estimated frequency of the hemizygous deletion, these results emphasise the role 
of the 15q15.3 locus in patients with (syndromic) hearing impairment. 
Furthermore, this case illustrates the importance of not automatically 
eliminating registered CNVs from further analysis.

Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) has 
revolutionized clinical cytogenetics, as it provides a relatively quick method 
to scan the genome for gains and losses of chromosomal material with 
significantly higher resolution and greater clinical yield than was previously 
possible. A number of different array CGH platforms have emerged and are being 
used successfully in the diagnostic setting. In the past few years, these new 
methodologies have led to the identification of novel genomic disorders in 
patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital 
anomalies (DD/MR/MCA) as well as the discovery that each individual carries 
inherited copy number variations (CNV) whose contributions to genetic variation 
and complex disease are not yet well understood. Although array CGH is currently 
being used as an adjunct test to standard karyotype analysis, it is likely to 
become the genetic test of choice, especially in cases of idiopathic MR/MCA.

BACKGROUND: Microarray genome analysis is realising its promise for improving 
detection of genetic abnormalities in individuals with mental retardation and 
congenital abnormality. Copy number variations (CNVs) are now readily detectable 
using a variety of platforms and a major challenge is the distinction of 
pathogenic from ubiquitous, benign polymorphic CNVs. The aim of this study was 
to investigate replacement of time consuming, locus specific testing for 
specific microdeletion and microduplication syndromes with microarray analysis, 
which theoretically should detect all known syndromes with CNV aetiologies as 
well as new ones.
METHODS: Genome wide copy number analysis was performed on 117 patients using 
Affymetrix 250K microarrays.
RESULTS: 434 CNVs (195 losses and 239 gains) were found, including 18 pathogenic 
CNVs and 9 identified as "potentially pathogenic". Almost all pathogenic CNVs 
were larger than 500 kb, significantly larger than the median size of all CNVs 
detected. Segmental regions of loss of heterozygosity larger than 5 Mb were 
found in 5 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Genome microarray analysis has improved diagnostic success in this 
group of patients. Several examples of recently discovered "new syndromes" were 
found suggesting they are more common than previously suspected and collectively 
are likely to be a major cause of mental retardation. The findings have several 
implications for clinical practice. The study revealed the potential to make 
genetic diagnoses that were not evident in the clinical presentation, with 
implications for pretest counselling and the consent process. The importance of 
contributing novel CNVs to high quality databases for genotype-phenotype 
analysis and review of guidelines for selection of individuals for microarray 
analysis is emphasised.

Array genomic hybridization (AGH) can detect chromosomal gains or losses that 
are 100 times smaller than those identifiable by conventional cytogenetic 
methods. Genome-wide AGH can identify genomic imbalance that causes birth 
defects and mental retardation at least twice as frequently as conventional 
cytogenetic analysis. Using AGH as a prenatal test for fetal genomic imbalance 
offers the promise of detecting pathogenic gain or loss of genomic material more 
quickly and much more frequently than current methods. However, the chance of 
finding a result of uncertain clinical significance is much greater than with 
conventional cytogenetic analysis, and the benefit-cost ratio of doing AGH in 
addition to conventional cytogenetic analysis in pregnancies at high risk for 
Down syndrome is likely to be poor. Very little is known about the natural 
history and range of clinical variability associated with most pathogenic 
submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs). It seems doubtful that patients can 
be adequately counseled for prenatal AGH testing in most cases because the risks 
and benefits are unknown. At present, AGH should be offered for prenatal 
diagnosis only if the pregnancy is at especially high risk of having a 
pathogenic CNV or if AGH is being done as part of a clinical trial.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the visual outcome of patients with subfoveal choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia treated with verteporfin 
photodynamic therapy (PDT-V) and to verify the predictive role of visual and 
angiographic parameters.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series study 
of subjects with subfoveal CNV secondary to pathologic myopia. All patients 
received PDT-V according to VIP guidelines. A complete ophthalmologic evaluation 
was performed on all patients and included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), 
fundus examination, and fluorescein angiography (FA, IMAGEnet System, Topcon 
Corp., Japan). CNV size (mm2) was directly measured on the early phase of the 
angiogram using the software included with the IMAGEnet package. All checks were 
scheduled at 3-month intervals for a period of 1 year. A review of medical and 
angiographic records was performed and assessed throughout a 12-month follow-up 
period.
RESULTS: A total of 62 patients (62 eyes) were examined. Best-corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA) moderately decreased without reaching a statistically noticeable 
level throughout the followup; reduction in lesion size reached a significant 
level at the second checkup. A significant correlation between higher baseline 
BCVA and better final visual outcome was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Standardized PDT-V minimizes central vision deterioration in 
patients with CNV secondary to pathologic myopia. Better BCVA at presentation 
represents a good predictive sign.

AIM: To evaluate the implications of intravitreal bevacizumab on proangiogenic 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with regard to the endogenous 
angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin in human choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: Retrospective review of an interventional case series of 48 patients 
who underwent full macular translocation surgery with removal of CNV. 
Twenty-five patients were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injection 1 to 
154 days prior to surgery (bevacizumab CNV). Twenty-three CNV without any kind 
of previous treatment were used as controls (control CNV). CNV were stained for 
CD34, cytokeratin18, VEGF, endostatin and E-selectin. A "predominance score of 
VEGF over endostatin" (PS) was defined by the difference between VEGF and 
endostatin staining scores.
RESULTS: Bevacizumab CNV revealed a weaker VEGF expression in endothelial cells 
(p = 0.0245) but significantly more intense endostatin in retina pigment 
epithelium (RPE) (p = 0.0001) and stroma (p<0.0001). Consequently, PS was 
significantly lower in RPE (p = 0.02), vessels (p = 0.03) and stroma (p = 
0.0004) in bevacizumab CNV. The intensity of E-selectin expression in 
bevacizumab CNV was comparable with that in control CNV.
CONCLUSIONS: A shift within the angiogenic balance in terms of decreased VEGF 
predominance over endostatin is detected in human CNV treated with bevacizumab.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc, South 
San Francisco, California) on inflammation and proliferation in human choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
METHODS: Retrospective review of interventional series of 38 patients who 
underwent choroidal neaovascular membrane (CNVM) extraction. Twenty-four 
patients received intravitreal bevacizumab 1 to 154 days preoperatively 
(bevacizumab CNV group). Fourteen patients received no preoperative therapy 
(control CNV group). The CNVM were stained for cytokeratin 18, CD68, CD45, 
intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, Ki-67, Thy-1, and 
endostatin.
RESULTS: No significant difference was detected in ICAM-1 and E-selectin 
expression between groups. The density of leukocytes in the bevacizumab CNV 
group (median, 271.61 cells/mm(2)) was higher than in the control CNV group 
(median, 116.87 cells/mm(2); P = .07), but without significance. Density of 
macrophages (median, 4661.95 cells/mm(2)), proliferative activity (median, 
160.19 cells/mm(2)), and percentage of Thy-1-expressing vessels (median, 100%) 
were significantly higher in the bevacizumab CNV group than in the control CNV 
group (median, 882.66 cells/mm(2), P < .001; median, 34.34 cells/mm(2), P < 
.001; and median, 80%, P < .001, respectively). Endostatin immunoreactivity was 
considerably stronger in the retina pigment epithelium (RPE)-Bruch membrane 
complex (median, 3; range, 2-3; P < .001), and stroma (median, 3; range, 1-3; P 
< .001) of the bevacizumab CNV group than control CNV group (median, 1.5; range, 
0-3 and median, 1; range, 0-3, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, CNVM from patients treated by bevacizumab are 
characterized by significantly high inflammatory and proliferative activity and 
enhanced endostatin expression. These characteristics need to be considered when 
protocols for combination therapies are established.

Cytogenetics allows detection of genomic anomalies between 10 and 15 Mb 
(classical cytogenetics) and between 3 and 5 Mb (high-resolution cytogenetics). 
These pangenomic techniques are associated with more accurate analyses, single 
probe interstitial FISH and subtelomeric studies. Array-CGH (aCGH) allows high 
resolution pangenomic analyses. BAC/PAC and oligonucleotides array-CGH have 
transformed the field of genetics and are useful for constitutional, 
hematological and solid tumors cytogenetics. Array-based comparative pangenomic 
hybridization resolutions vary in size (range, several kilobases to 1 Mb). With 
the more recent improvements, aCGH is becoming the "missing link" between 
cytogenetics and molecular diagnostics. Despite copy number variations (CNV) and 
without replacing karyotype, aCGH detects cryptic quantitative anomalies 
anywhere in the genome and becomes day after day more useful.

MLPA and MAPH: sensitive detection of deletions and duplications.

den Dunnen JT(1), White SJ.

Author information:

Netherlands.

The detection of quantitative changes in genomic DNA, i.e., deletions and 
duplications or so called Copy Number Variants (CNV), is an important element of 
a complete mutation screening strategy. However, because of practical 
difficulties, screening for quantitative changes in genomic DNA is often 
ignored. Hitherto, the techniques available were technically challenging and 
laborious and thus too costly to be applied on a routine basis. The development 
of MAPH (Multiplex Amplifiable Probe Hybridization) and more recently MLPA 
(Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification) have revived interest in the 
detection of deletions and duplications, primarily due to the simplicity and 
flexibility of these two approaches. Compared to previous technologies, e.g., 
Southern blotting, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), quantitative PCR 
(qPCR), and breakpoint PCR, they have some clear advantages, including high 
resolution, high throughput, amenability to multiplexing, and simplicity.

Copy number variations (CNVs) have effects on phenotypes by altering 
transcription levels of genes and may have major impacts on protein sequence, 
structure and function. Therefore, CNV screening and analysis focused on the 
identification of CNV-genetic disease relations are actively progressing. CNVs 
can be detected and analyzed by various methodologies at the genome-wide and 
locus-specific levels. The genome-wide analysis of CNVs has been enhanced by 
bioinformatic tools for long-range sequence analysis, and comparative genome 
hybridization using microarrays containing either single nucleotide 
polymorphisms or bacterial artificial chromosome clones that represent the whole 
genome. RFLP followed by Southern blot analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, 
pyrosequencing, ligation detection reaction and the invader assay have become 
the main tools for locus-specific analysis so far. In this review, we present a 
brief principle, application history, and strengths and weaknesses of the 
methods used to detect CNVs at the genome-wide and locus-specific levels.

The detection of quantitative changes in genomic DNA, i.e. deletions and 
duplications or Copy Number Variants (CNVs), has recently gained considerable 
interest. First, detailed analysis of the human genome showed a surprising 
amount of CNVs, involving thousands of genes. Second, it was realised that the 
detection of CNVs as a cause of genetic disease was often neglected, but should 
be an essential part of a complete screening strategy. In both cases new 
efficient CNV screening methods, covering the entire range from specific loci to 
genome-wide, were behind these developments. This paper will briefly review the 
methods that are available to detect CNVs, discuss their strong and weak points, 
show some new developments and look ahead. Methods covered include microscopy, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (including fiber-FISH), Southern blotting, 
PCR-based methods (including MLPA), array technology and massive parallel 
sequencing. In addition, we will show some new developments, including a 
1400-plex CNV bead assay, fast-MLPA (from DNA to result in approximately 6 h) 
and a simple Melting Curve Analysis assay to confirm potential CNVs. Using the 
1400-plex CNV bead assay, targeting selected chromosomal regions only, we 
detected confirmed rearrangements in 9% of 320 mental retardation patients 
studied.

Copy number variation and mosaicism.

Notini AJ(1), Craig JM, White SJ.

Author information:
(1)Molecular Development, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal 
Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Vic. Australia.

Mosaicism is the presence of cells within an organism that have a different 
genetic composition despite deriving from a single zygote. The consequence of 
this depends on the number and type of cells that are affected as well as the 
specific DNA involved. There are several diseases where mosaicism is known to 
occur, but the currently observed frequency is presumably an underestimation due 
to the difficulty of detecting changes in only a percentage of cells. Recent 
advances in technology have provided a greater insight into the frequency and 
mechanisms of mosaicism in all forms. This review will cover the different 
techniques that can be used for detecting copy number variation (CNV) in mosaic 
form, and describe some of the insights that different diseases have given on 
the true frequencies and mechanisms responsible for somatic rearrangements. It 
will conclude with a discussion of the implications of the recent description of 
CNV in identical twins, and what remains to be elucidated in the world of mosaic 
CNV.

Copy number variation (CNV) is an important source of genomic variation. 
Characterizing CNVs in phenotypically normal individuals is important for 
understanding the functional significance of these variants. Many studies have 
reported CNVs in control populations, but wide variability is observed in their 
design and outcome. Importantly, medical and phenotypic information for control 
populations must be carefully documented, and accurate genotyping will be 
necessary to determine the population genetics of CNVs. Despite existing 
challenges in studying this class of variants, it is evident that CNVs are 
ubiquitous in human genomes, with non-random distribution, and they affect 
thousands of coding regions, potentially contributing to human disease and 
phenotypic variability. Higher-resolution detection platforms and improved 
algorithms will further define our understanding of CNVs in control populations, 
leading to development of effective disease-association studies.

USA.

PURPOSE: To compare noninvasive autofluorescence (AF) photography with 
conventional fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA) in the 
detection of basal laminar drusen (BLD).
METHODS: A retrospective case review of 20 patients with BLD studied with AF and 
conventional imaging was performed. Three selected patients with different 
degrees of BLD are presented. AF imaging employed an excitation filter at 580 nm 
and a barrier filter at 695 nm with acquisition by a Topcon 50X fundus camera. 
Corresponding detail regions in each image were enlarged for comparison. The AF 
detail image was registered by a projective transformation in Matlab (Mathworks 
7.0, Natick, MA) with the color photograph/red free photograph (RF) and/or FA 
image detail for exact superimposition in Photoshop and lesion comparison.
RESULTS: Each visible drusen in the color or RF photograph corresponded when 
superimposed to a focal hypoautofluorescent lesion in the AF image. However, 
similar to the starry sky pattern in FA, the AF lesions significantly 
outnumbered the clinically evident drusen. When BLD lesions were not advanced 
enough to show the classic starry sky fluorescein hyperfluorescence, the BLD 
were detectable with AF.
CONCLUSIONS: In our case series, AF imaging demonstrated a higher level of 
sensitivity when compared with conventional fundus photography and is less 
invasive than FA for the detection of BLD. Fundus AF, therefore, is valuable for 
diagnosing and following BLD, particularly since these patients are at risk for 
development of pseudovitelliform detachment which may simulate CNV.

neovascular AMD in fellow eyes of 364 participants at risk. Subjects were 
eligible for a minimum of 2 years of follow-up with angiograms of eyes at risk 
reevaluated to estimate incidence rates of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) 
and to characterize these lesions.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of CNV during follow-up, characteristics of the 
incident lesion (composition, size, and location), and visual acuity at the time 
of incidence.
RESULTS: Incident lesions were confirmed in 98 fellow eyes of participants, 
yielding 2- and 4-year cumulative incidence rates of 22% and 37%. Incident 
lesions were predominantly CNV in 87 fellow eyes (90%), extrafoveal in 29 fellow 
eyes (30%), and juxtafoveal in 9 fellow eyes (9%). Occult without classic CNV 
lesions were found in 64 eyes (67%), minimally classic CNV and predominantly 
classic CNV lesions in 12 eyes (13%) each, and predominantly blood lesions in 4 
eyes (4%). Nearly two-thirds of all incident lesions were 3 disc areas or 
smaller in size. Median visual acuity decreased from 20/25 at baseline to 20/250 
at the 4-year follow-up in fellow eyes with incident CNV. CONCLUSIONS AND 
APPLICATION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Frequent angiographic follow-up of fellow eyes 
at risk for CNV may lead to earlier detection and treatment of neovascular AMD 
and better visual acuity outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The main cause for visual loss in age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) is the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which has been 
shown to occur in 18% of patients over 5 years. Even though satisfactory 
treatments for CNV are available, in the majority of cases no improvement in 
visual acuity occurs and in those it does it is mostly limited. Early detection 
has the potential of significantly improving the final visual outcome of 
patients who develop subfoveal CNV.
METHODS: This review is a summary of the importance of early detection in the 
management of AMD, in view of the current available treatment methods. It is a 
review of the results of early detection of AMD using the Preferential 
Hyperacuity Perimeter (PHP).
RESULTS: Awareness for symptoms, use of the Amsler grid and monitoring by an 
ophthalmologist are not satisfactory means for early detection of AMD. The PHP 
has good sensitivity and specificity in detecting CNV patient early and 
differentiate them from intermediate AMD.
CONCLUSION: In an era of excellent treatments available for CNV treatment, early 
detection of CNV by novel technology modalities such as the PHP at a frequency 
that allows early detection (approximately 4 times a year) is crucial in the 
armamentarium of AMD patient management.

The association of DNA copy-number variation (CNV) with specific gene function 
and human disease has been long known, but the wide scope and prevalence of this 
form of variation has only recently been fully appreciated. The latest studies 
using microarray technology have demonstrated that as much as 12% of the human 
genome and thousands of genes are variable in copy number, and this diversity is 
likely to be responsible for a significant proportion of normal phenotypic 
variation. Current challenges involve developing methods not only for detecting 
and cataloging CNVs in human populations at increasingly higher resolution but 
also for determining the association of CNVs with biological function, recent 
human evolution, and common and complex human disease.

AIM: To evaluate expression of proangiogenic matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 
and 9 at distinct intervals after verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) in 
human choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) secondary to age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD).
METHODS: Retrospective review of an interventional case series of 49 patients 
who underwent removal of CNV. Twenty-six patients were treated with PDT 3 to 383 
days prior to surgery. Twenty-three CNV without previous treatment were used as 
controls. CNV were stained for CD34, cytokeratin 18, endostatin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 
by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: CNV without previous therapy disclosed MMP-2, MMP-9 in RPE-Bruch's 
membrane, vessels and stroma in different intensities. Three days after PDT, 
MMP-9 expression was significantly weaker in stroma (p = 0.0019). Endostatin was 
significantly reduced in vessels (p<0.001). At longer post-PDT intervals, a 
significant increase of MMP-9 in stroma (p = 0.037) and of endostatin in 
RPE-Bruch's membrane (p = 0.02), vessels (p = 0.005) and stroma (p<0.001) were 
disclosed. No significant changes in MMP-2 expression were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: PDT induced an early, temporary decrease in MMP-9 and endostatin 
expression. At longer intervals, MMP-9 increase is possibly associated with the 
angiogenic process responsible for recurrence after PDT. MMP-9, however, acts as 
a double-edged sword by concomitant induction of endostatin, an endogenous 
inhibitor of angiogenesis.

School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a molecular cytogenetic 
technique used in detecting and mapping DNA copy number alterations. aCGH is 
able to interrogate the entire genome at a previously unattainable, high 
resolution and has directly led to the recent appreciation of a novel class of 
genomic variation: copy number variation (CNV) in mammalian genomes. All forms 
of DNA variation/polymorphism are important for studying the basis of phenotypic 
diversity among individuals. CNV research is still at its infancy, requiring 
careful collation and annotation of accumulating CNV data that will undoubtedly 
be useful for accurate interpretation of genomic imbalances identified during 
cancer research.

Netherlands.

Recent developments have yielded new technologies that have greatly simplified 
the detection of deletions and duplications, i.e., copy number variants (CNVs). 
These technologies can be used to screen for CNVs in and around specific genomic 
regions, as well as genome-wide. Several genome-wide studies have demonstrated 
that CNV in the human genome is widespread and may include millions of 
nucleotides. One of the questions that emerge is which sequences, structures 
and/or processes are involved in their generation. Using as an example the human 
DMD gene, mutations in which cause Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, we 
review the current data, determine the deletion and duplication profile across 
the gene and summarize the information that has been collected regarding their 
origin. In addition we discuss the methods most frequently used for their 
detection, in particular MAPH and MLPA.

Vision loss in younger patients: a review of choroidal neovascularization.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a common cause of vision loss in patients 
<50 years of age. In these patients, CNV is often the result of pathologic 
myopia, ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, or idiopathic causes. 
Rarely, CNV is seen in children, usually in association with inherited macular 
dystrophies such as Best's disease (vitelliform macular dystrophy) or drusen of 
the optic nerve. This article discusses the role of optometrists in the 
detection and management of CNV. Untreated CNV can cause rapid deterioration of 
central vision and is associated with a poor prognosis. Optometrists may be able 
to improve the prognosis of younger patients with CNV by recognizing the signs, 
symptoms, and risk factors for CNV and promptly referring patients with 
suspected CNV to a retina specialist. They can also help patients by providing 
long-term support and rehabilitation. Recent treatment advances, such as the 
availability of verteporfin (Visudyne; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) 
therapy, that are applicable to younger patients with CNV have increased the 
importance of early detection of CNV and prompt referral of patients to a 
specialist who can treat CNV.

AIM: To evaluate the impact of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the 
induction of apoptosis in choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) secondary to age 
related macular degeneration.
METHODS: Retrospective review of 22 surgically excised CNV. 12 of these patients 
had been treated with PDT 3-146 days previously. Apoptotic cells were detected 
with the TUNEL technique and compared to the expression of CD34 (endothelial 
cells, EC), CD105 (activated endothelial cells), Ki-67 (proliferation marker), 
and cytokeratin18 (retinal pigment epithelial cells, RPE).
RESULTS: CNV excised 3 days after PDT were characterised both by collapsed and 
patent vessels. The EC displayed a statistical significant positive TUNEL 
reaction when compared to the remaining treated CNV (p < 0.001) and untreated 
CNV (P = 0.002). The proliferative activity was reduced. CNV excised 1-5 months 
after PDT displayed a patent vascularisation and high proliferative activity. 
All membranes either treated or untreated disclosed only sporadic TUNEL positive 
cells within the stroma and the RPE.
CONCLUSIONS: Verteporfin PDT leads to selective and effective damage of EC 
within CNV. Both patent and occluded vessels were lined by apoptotic EC. This 
finding and the increased expression of proliferation marker at later time 
points suggest that revascularisation after PDT is caused by angiogenesis rather 
than recanalisation.

There has been an increase in the use of psychophysiological techniques, 
especially event-related potentials (ERPs) to evaluate the effects of odor on 
the central nervous system. In the study of ERPs related to odor, there are two 
main methods of the odor presentation: (1) to investigate the olfactory ERP 
(OERP) or chemosensory ERP (CSERP), that is to calculate electrophysiological 
responses to odor stimulation as a trigger; (2) to compare ERP of mental 
functioning during the odor exposed condition with that of no odor exposure. The 
amplitude of contingent negative variation (CNV) varies with the odorant being 
present, when the odor is presented as a trigger and when it is administrated 
during a task. It is suggested that CNV changes depend on not only the odorant 
but the anticipation, expectation and emotion of the subject. The latency of the 
N1 component becomes shorter with increasing concentrations of odors. The N1 
amplitude does not depend on the odor concentration while the amplitude of the 
auditory N1 strongly depends on the stimulus intensity. There is only one report 
that the olfactory mismatch negativity (MMN) is present in the CSERP. On the 
other hand, auditory MMN is not affected by odor administration. In relation to 
the P3 component, rare odors evoked a larger amplitude in contrast to frequent 
odors, as well as P3 evoked by other modalities. These ERP studies with odors 
are expected to be applied to such clinical settings as the differentiation 
between the anosmic patients and normosmic persons, the functional evaluation of 
patients with brain tumors, the earlier detection of dementia, and the objective 
evaluation of aromatherapy.

Recent advances in the management of age-related macular degeneration.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) can cause rapid and severe central vision loss in many older people. Until 
recently, the only treatment proven beneficial was thermal laser 
photocoagulation, which was applicable to only a small subset of patients. 
Furthermore, the thermal laser damaged the retina overlying the CNV, which is 
especially problematic for lesions involving the foveal center. Photodynamic 
therapy is a new treatment consisting of intravenous infusion of a drug that is 
then activated by a low-energy laser, causing damage to CNV. Photodynamic 
therapy with verteporfin (Visudyne, Novartis AG) has been shown to reduce the 
risk of moderate and severe vision loss in patients with predominantly classic 
subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. With the advent of verteporfin therapy, eye care 
providers will play an increasingly important role in managing patients with 
AMD, especially in the early detection and rapid referral of appropriate cases.

[Choroidal neovascularization].

[Article in Romanian]

Nechita A, Cârstocea B, Filip M.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) may occur in any ocular condition affecting 
the integrity of the choriocapillaris-Bruch's membrane-retinal pigment 
epithelium-outer retinal layer complex. CNV in the macula is a major cause of 
severe central visual loss. A variety of clinical symptoms suggest the diagnosis 
of CNV. Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography play a very important role 
in the detection and precise localization of CNV in relation to the centre of 
the foveal avascular zone. In the present, CNV benefits by many treatment 
possibilities. The goal of treatment is specifically to decrease the risk of 
visual acuity loss.

Early detection, diagnosis and management of choroidal neovascularization in 
age-related macular degeneration: the role of ophthalmologists.

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD) is a serious condition which, if unrecognized and untreated, can result in 
the rapid deterioration of vision. Early detection and prompt referral to a 
retina specialist may potentially reduce the high risk of severe vision loss. 
The majority of AMD patients with CNV who present to an ophthalmologist will 
have been referred by either a primary care physician or an optometrist. 
Following referral, ophthalmologists will confirm diagnosis and identify the 
location and composition of the CNV. This information will provide the basis for 
a decision on what treatment, if any, is indicated. Until last year, laser 
photocoagulation was the only clinically-proven treatment option for neovascular 
AMD in large-scale randomized clinical trials, although many patients were not 
eligible for this treatment. Verteporfin (Visudyne(TM)) therapy is a new 
treatment option that uses photodynamic therapy in patients with predominantly 
classic subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD. Retrospective analyses show that the 
introduction of verteporfin therapy is likely to increase the number of patients 
with neovascular AMD who can be treated. Early detection, prompt referral and 
treatment, together with appropriate use of low vision aids, will help to 
optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.

The EEG effects of tobacco smoking--a review.

Conrin J.

In summary, smoking does produce obvious changes in EEG activity. Human studies 
have been limited to surface electrodes. These have provided evidence of the 
alpha, evoked potential, and CNV effects of smoking. Changes in alpha and evoked 
potential activity have been statistically analyzed across subjects. These 
analyses indicated statistically significant arousal effects. However, large 
individual differences in responding were observed but not analyzed. Analysis of 
individual data in the Ashton, et. al. (1974) study indicated some arousal 
effects and some sedative effects, depending on the personality characteristics 
of the individual subject. Differential effects might have been detected in 
other studies had individual subject data been adequately analyzed. In research 
with nonhuman subjects, nicotine and tobacco smoke produced cortical arousal and 
sometimes a biphasic effect of arousal followed by apparent sedation. Behavioral 
effects accompanied the cortical arousal, including eyelid opening, head 
movements, and eye movements. During the synchronization phase, crouching, low 
mobility, and closed eyes occurred. Both the limbic and reticular activating 
systems seem to be affected by nicotine and smoking with the hippocampus most 
noticeably affected.
